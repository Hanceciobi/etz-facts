  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “trust” mean in crypto investing: code security, custody, or community signals?",
    "How do you evaluate a blockchain’s reliability beyond price charts?",
    "What wallet and exchange security checks matter most before you deposit funds?",
    "How can you reduce the chance of scams, phishing, and operational mistakes?",
    "What simple routines help you stay disciplined through volatility and news cycles?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Separate trust layers: protocol security, platform security, and your own operational security.",
    "Start with basics: verify official links, confirm token/network details, and test with small amounts.",
    "Use strong account hygiene: 2FA, unique passwords, hardware wallet for long-term holdings.",
    "Diversify and size positions for volatility; avoid leverage until you understand drawdown behavior.",
    "Keep a repeatable checklist for transfers, backups, and suspicious messages before every move."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Pick your focus: long-term investing, active trading, or simply learning. Then build trust from the ground up: verify the protocol, secure custody, and only then scale position size.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You’re new to crypto and want to avoid common traps",
        "then": [
          "Use well-known assets first and avoid viral “too good to be true” launches.",
          "Start with small test transactions and keep long-term funds separate from swap/trade activity."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Your main concern is security and custody",
        "then": [
          "Prefer self-custody for meaningful holdings and keep backups offline.",
          "Treat every support message and link as suspicious until verified via official channels."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Volatility is stressing your decision-making",
        "then": [
          "Use a risk budget and diversification; reduce size until drawdowns feel manageable.",
          "Consider staged entries (DCA) and pre-planned exits rather than reacting to headlines."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Crypto has fewer safety nets than banks; custody mistakes can be irreversible.",
    "Scams exploit urgency and trust; slow down and verify before sending funds or signing anything.",
    "Price moves alone do not prove reliability; trust is built from security, transparency, and operational discipline."

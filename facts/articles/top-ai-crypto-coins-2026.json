  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does an “AI coin” actually do, beyond marketing?",
    "How can you tell whether a token is essential to compute/data/coordination—or just bolted on?",
    "Which AI-crypto categories matter most in 2026: compute networks, data markets, agent platforms, or AI marketplaces?",
    "What adoption signals matter more than price and hype?",
    "What are the biggest practical risks (incentive gaming, thin liquidity, security, UX), and how do you manage them?",
    "How do you build a defensible watchlist you can keep updating over time?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with impact: define what gets cheaper, faster, safer, or easier thanks to the project.",
    "Trace the flywheel: who supplies compute/data/agents today, and why they return tomorrow.",
    "Prioritize deployments over demos: look for paid jobs, integrations, and recurring usage.",
    "Track a monthly scorecard: supply depth, demand proof, cost/latency vs incumbents, developer activity.",
    "Manage risk: expect correlation during mania, and update the thesis every quarter."

        "then": [
          "Pause the research and restate the user benefit in plain language",
          "Check whether the token coordinates compute, data licensing, or incentives (not vibes)",
          "If the value proposition stays vague, remove it from your short list"

      },
      {
        "if": "The project has big claims but no visible usage",
        "then": [
          "Look for paid jobs, production integrations, or recurring users (not just hackathons)",
          "Check developer activity and ecosystem growth rather than social metrics",
          "Set a thesis expiry date (e.g., 90 days) unless new evidence appears"

      {
        "if": "You’re worried about incentive gaming, thin liquidity, or security",
        "then": [
          "Size positions assuming exits may be noisy and slippage-heavy",
          "Prefer projects with transparent metrics and robust reputation/anti-sybil design",

  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Most failures look like incentives being gamed, not the tech being impossible.",
    "Thin liquidity and concentration can turn normal volatility into forced exits.",
    "If onboarding and reliability aren’t close to web2 standards, adoption stalls.",
    "Security is end-to-end: contracts, off-chain endpoints, and user behavior all matter."

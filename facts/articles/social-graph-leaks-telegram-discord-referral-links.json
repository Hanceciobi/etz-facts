    "Separate personas: keep your swap/storage identity away from your public chat and points-farming identity.",
    "Use a dedicated campaign wallet for quests, bots, referrals, and role-gated servers; never bridge it to serious funds.",
    "Treat tracked links as attribution tools: avoid reusing the same UTM/referral URL across accounts, sessions, or wallets.",
    "Reduce click-path correlation: avoid in-app browsing for sensitive actions and minimize session overlap between chats and swaps.",
    "Stop screenshot leaks: share minimal context in support chats, crop aggressively, and avoid posting full timelines or identifiers."

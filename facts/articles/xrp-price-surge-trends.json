  "keyQuestions": [
    "What tends to drive sudden XRP rallies: regulation, adoption news, or broader market risk-on moves?",
    "How does Ripple’s business progress translate (or not translate) into XRP demand?",
    "Which indicators help you distinguish a sustainable trend from a short squeeze?",
    "What are the practical risks for XRP holders: volatility, liquidity gaps, and headline shocks?",
    "How do you plan entries and exits without getting caught by whipsaws?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Identify the catalyst: legal headlines, partnership announcements, or market-wide momentum.",
    "Check liquidity first: spread, depth, and where most volume is concentrated.",
    "Use staged execution: break entries/exits into tranches and prefer limit orders.",
    "Set invalidation levels in advance and avoid leverage into headline volatility.",
    "Keep custody and operational hygiene tight: correct networks, verified addresses, and safe device workflows."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with the catalyst and the liquidity picture. If the move is headline-driven, treat it as higher volatility and reduce position size or use staged execution.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "The rally is driven by regulatory or court-related news",
        "then": [
          "Expect fast repricing and reversals; avoid chasing vertical candles.",
          "Use smaller size and wider time horizon, or wait for consolidation."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The rally is driven by adoption/partnership narratives",
        "then": [
          "Look for follow-through: repeat announcements, measurable usage, and sustained volume.",
          "Fade hype if volume collapses quickly after the headline."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Liquidity becomes thin or spreads widen",
        "then": [
          "Reduce clip size and avoid market orders during volatile windows.",
          "Execute during higher-liquidity sessions and consider splitting orders."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "XRP is headline-sensitive; sharp moves can reverse quickly when narratives change.",
    "Liquidity can fragment across venues; execution quality (spread/slippage) matters for real outcomes.",
    "Do not assume a single catalyst guarantees a trend; confirm with volume, depth, and market conditions."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a 51% attack and what can it realistically do to a PoW chain?",
    "What happened during the Qubic-related Monero reorganizations?",
    "How did exchanges and the Monero community respond in practice?",
    "Why can hashrate economics be a bigger risk than protocol bugs?",
    "Which mitigations are discussed (decentralization, checkpoints, merge mining) and what trade-offs do they bring?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat large confirmations seriously during suspected reorg periods; do not rush deposits.",
    "Follow exchange notices and official community channels for confirmation guidance.",
    "Avoid large, time-sensitive transfers until the chain is stable again.",
    "Keep TXIDs and timestamps; document everything if you need support.",
    "Prefer non-custodial workflows and minimize time funds sit on custodial venues."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "If you’re moving XMR during or after a reorg event, start by deciding whether you can delay the transfer; if not, increase safety margins and documentation.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You can wait for stability",
        "then": [
          "Pause large transfers until reorg chatter and exchange warnings subside.",
          "Monitor confirmations and network status from multiple sources.",
          "Resume with a small test transfer before moving full size."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You must transfer now (time-sensitive)",
        "then": [
          "Use higher confirmation thresholds and conservative amounts.",
          "Avoid routing through venues that currently pause deposits/withdrawals.",
          "Keep a clear paper trail (TXIDs, screenshots, timestamps) for any dispute."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Reorg/double-spend risk rises when a single entity can influence block production.",
    "Exchange policy risk: platforms may pause deposits or raise confirmation requirements without notice.",
    "Market risk: headline-driven volatility can spike during security incidents.",
    "Operational risk: confusion about confirmations and chain state can cause mistakes under stress."

    "What does “privacy by default” mean in Monero, and why does it matter?",

  "quickSteps": [
    "Write your seed phrase on paper and keep at least two separated backups.",
    "Check addresses as a ritual before every send to defeat clipboard swaps.",
    "Separate hot and cold wallets so daily use can’t expose long-term savings.",
    "Use subaddresses per context to reduce accidental linkage.",
    "Prefer default privacy settings; avoid “clever tweaks” that leak.",
    "When converting, choose non-custodial, account-free routes and keep proofs privately."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Privacy is technology plus routine; sloppy habits can undo strong cryptography.",
    "Metadata leaks (IP, timing, KYC deposits, chats) can re-identify flows even when amounts are hidden.",
    "Optional privacy in other systems often leaks via mixed-mode usage and smaller anonymity sets.",
    "Address/identity reuse creates long-lived biographies; separate contexts by design.",
    "Custodial “privacy” routes trade analysis risk for counterparty and seizure risk."

    "Understand how Ethereum mixers, shielded pools and privacy-focused ZK L2s change what is visible on-chain, and where they still leak timing, amount or address information.",
    "Separate your Ethereum activity into roles: long-term holdings, DeFi experiments, payments and privacy-critical flows, instead of using a single exposed main address.",
    "Choose one or two mature privacy layers to master—such as a shielded pool, a privacy L2 or a dedicated ETH→XMR→ETH route—instead of constantly switching tools.",
    "Treat entry and exit points as critical: use dedicated wallets for privacy tools, avoid obvious address reuse and keep ETH↔XMR swaps or L2 bridges simple and explainable.",
    "Keep a minimal private record of large transfers and privacy steps so you can calmly explain source-of-funds to banks or KYC exchanges when compliance questions arise."

    "Use self-custody wallets and keep your seed offline (no screenshots/cloud).",
    "Treat swaps as data minimization: avoid accounts when custody isn’t required.",

    "Privacy is not invisibility: edge metadata (IP, timing, KYC deposits, chats) can re-link activity.",
    "No pooled balances reduce catastrophic custodial failure risk, but user-side hygiene still matters.",
    "Wrong network selection and rushed transfers are common causes of delays.",
    "Over-collecting identity data creates breach magnets and long-lived profiling risk.",
    "Good private records enable compliance without surrendering personal data to every intermediary."

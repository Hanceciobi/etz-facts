    "riskNotes": [
      "Home and small-scale Bitcoin mining in 2026 faces thin margins that can flip negative after halvings, difficulty jumps or local power price hikes.",
      "Treating mining only as a technical hobby while ignoring tax, regulatory and custody obligations can turn a profitable setup into a compliance liability.",
      "Using anonymous or non-custodial swap routes without a strict criteria checklist exposes miners to outright scams and platforms that invite legal trouble.",
      "Over-concentrating all payouts on a single exchange account increases the impact of sudden freezes, security incidents or policy changes at that venue."
    ],
    "keyTakeaways": [
      "Mining economics depend less on simply owning an ASIC and more on full CAPEX/OPEX accounting plus realistic BTC price and difficulty assumptions.",
      "Local regulation, tax rules and basic wallet security are as important as hashrate when deciding whether a small mining operation makes sense.",
      "Non-custodial swaps and privacy coins like XMR are useful as deliberate tools for shaping cash flow and privacy buckets, not as magic exits.",
      "Miners benefit from pre-defined playbooks that describe when to expand or shut down rigs, how to split income between BTC, stablecoins and XMR, and which routes to use for which goals."

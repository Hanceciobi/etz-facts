  "keyQuestions": [
    "What makes Solana’s architecture different (PoH, parallel execution, sharding roadmap)?",
    "How do upcoming validator and client upgrades change performance and reliability?",
    "What signals show real ecosystem growth beyond price (developers, apps, revenue)?",
    "How should traders think about fees, liquidity, and slippage on Solana venues?",
    "What risks matter most in 2025 (outages, centralization, regulation, competition)?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Separate hype from fundamentals: look at usage, builders, and app revenue, not just price.",
    "Check the roadmap and client diversity (e.g., validator clients) for resilience.",
    "Evaluate liquidity where you trade: thin books create slippage even on fast chains.",
    "Use basic security hygiene: verified links, hardware wallet for long-term storage, and least-privilege approvals.",
    "Keep risk in view: infrastructure incidents and regulation can change timelines fast."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "If you’re deciding whether Solana fits your needs in 2025, start with your main goal: trading, building, or long-term holding.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You mainly trade and care about speed, fees, and execution",
        "then": [
          "Choose venues with deep liquidity and transparent fees.",
          "Expect slippage on volatile moves; size orders accordingly.",
          "Keep a separate wallet for active trading and monitor approvals."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You build apps and care about tooling and user growth",
        "then": [
          "Track developer activity, grants, and SDK maturity.",
          "Plan for upgrade cycles and test against client/version differences.",
          "Design for safety: minimize signatures/permissions and verify third-party integrations."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Reliability risk: even rare incidents can affect traders and apps at the worst moment.",
    "Centralization perceptions: validator and infrastructure concentration can become a headline risk.",
    "Regulatory risk: rules in the US/EU can change access, listings, and institutional pace.",
    "Competitive risk: L2s and alternative L1s keep pressure on user retention and fees."

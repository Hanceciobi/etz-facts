  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is Trump Coin, and what actually drives its demand?",
    "How do political headlines and media cycles translate into price moves?",
    "Why do meme coins swing so hard on sentiment and community activity?",
    "How do broader crypto market conditions affect small, themed tokens?",
    "What risk rules help you trade or hold a high-volatility meme asset?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat it as a high-volatility meme asset first; size risk accordingly.",
    "Track catalysts: political news, social media momentum, and listing/liquidity changes.",
    "Check market conditions (BTC/ETH trend, risk-on vs risk-off) before you interpret moves.",
    "Use staged entries/exits and prefer limit orders to reduce slippage during spikes.",
    "Keep operational hygiene tight: verify networks, start with a small test transfer, and store backups offline."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with the catalyst (headline vs broader market move), then validate liquidity and execution conditions. If it is purely sentiment-driven, reduce size and avoid leverage.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Price is moving on political headlines",
        "then": [
          "Expect fast reversals; avoid chasing vertical candles.",
          "Wait for consolidation or use smaller tranches with clear invalidation levels."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Community activity is surging (viral posts, coordinated campaigns)",
        "then": [
          "Treat momentum as time-sensitive; watch for volume fade and widening spreads.",
          "Plan exits ahead of time; do not rely on instant liquidity during a squeeze."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The wider market turns bearish",
        "then": [
          "Assume meme assets will underperform and draw down faster.",
          "Cut size, tighten risk limits, and prioritize capital preservation."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Meme assets can detach from fundamentals; sentiment can flip quickly and violently.",
    "Liquidity can dry up during stress, making execution costs (spread/slippage) the real risk.",
    "Political themes add headline risk; treat news-driven pumps and dumps as part of the asset’s nature."

    "Decide what share of your ETH stays simple and unlevered in spot or basic staking outside any restaking loops.",
    "Map which restaking protocols and liquid restaking tokens you actually plan to use, including their AVSs, withdrawal flow, audits, and governance.",
    "Read each protocol’s risk documentation carefully: slashing conditions, current AVS list, and realistic failure scenarios.",
    "Start with a small test allocation and watch how the LRT trades in practice: liquidity, discounts to underlying value, and depeg behaviour in stress.",
    "Review and rebalance your restaked ETH and LRT positions regularly as yields, risks, liquidity, and incentive programs change."

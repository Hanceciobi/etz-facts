    "What is BNB used for on Binance and on BNB Chain?",

    "How do Auto-Burn and BEP-95 reduce supply, and why does usage matter?",
    "What risks should you weigh when holding or using BNB?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide your purpose: fee savings, on-chain gas, staking, or ecosystem participation.",
    "Keep a small operational balance for fees (exchange or on-chain) before you transact.",
    "If using BNB Chain, verify network selection and wallet addresses to avoid wrong-chain mistakes.",
    "Track tokenomics changes (Auto-Burn cadence and BEP-95 burns) and ecosystem activity as leading indicators.",
    "Manage risk: diversify, use strong security hygiene, and reassess assumptions as conditions change."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your primary use case (exchange fees vs on-chain activity). Then pick the network and workflow that minimizes mistakes and fees.",

      {
        "if": "You mainly trade on Binance and want to reduce fees",
        "then": [
          "Enable paying trading fees in BNB where available.",
          "Maintain a small BNB balance so fee payments don’t fail during active periods."

      {
        "if": "You mainly use BNB Chain apps (DeFi, swaps, NFTs)",
        "then": [
          "Hold enough BNB for gas and confirm you’re on BNB Smart Chain when interacting with dApps.",
          "Double-check token contracts and approvals before signing transactions."

      },
      {
        "if": "You’re evaluating BNB as a long-term asset",
        "then": [
          "Monitor activity metrics and the burn trajectory instead of relying on single-point forecasts.",
          "Consider ecosystem concentration risk and regulatory headlines as part of your thesis."

      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "BNB is tightly coupled to a vertically integrated ecosystem; shocks in exchange activity, regulation, or chain security can ripple into demand.",
    "On-chain usage depends on app adoption and competition from other L1/L2 ecosystems; fee compression can change incentive dynamics.",
    "Most avoidable losses come from operational errors: wrong network, unverified addresses, or unsafe signing/approval flows."

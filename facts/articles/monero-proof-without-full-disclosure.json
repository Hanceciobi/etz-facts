    "Start by naming the exact question you must answer: prove a specific payment, show income for a period, or prove reserves at a point in time.",
    "For one-off disputes, use a Monero payment/transaction proof instead of sharing wallet history or any view-only access.",
    "If someone needs ongoing oversight, use a dedicated reporting wallet and share view-only access only for that wallet and only for the needed time window.",
    "Package your evidence so it’s easy to verify: invoice reference, recipient address/subaddress, dates, the proof string, and short copy-paste instructions.",
    "Shrink the blast radius: keep business and personal wallets separate, never share spend keys, and avoid screenshots that reveal unrelated transactions."

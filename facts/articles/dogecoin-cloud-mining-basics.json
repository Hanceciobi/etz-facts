  "keyQuestions": [
    "How does Dogecoin mining work, and why is merged mining with Litecoin so common?",
    "What does “cloud mining” really mean for a Scrypt-based coin like DOGE?",
    "Which contract terms and fees decide whether returns are plausible or impossible?",
    "How do you model profitability realistically under price and difficulty changes?",
    "What are the most reliable red flags for cloud mining scams?",
    "What safer alternatives exist if your real goal is DOGE exposure rather than mining?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Verify the provider: legal entity, operators, facility proof, and trackable payout history.",
    "Read the fee stack carefully (maintenance, pool, withdrawal, conversion spreads).",
    "Model outcomes with conservative price and difficulty assumptions—stress-test bear cases.",
    "Avoid “guaranteed ROI,” fixed daily percentages, and referral-heavy schemes.",
    "Start tiny: confirm one real payout and one successful withdrawal before scaling.",
    "Withdraw regularly and use 2FA + address whitelists to reduce account-takeover risk."

        "if": "The offer promises guaranteed returns or fixed daily percentages.",
        "then": [
          "Treat it as a red flag: mining revenue depends on difficulty and price.",
          "Ask for a full fee schedule and historical payouts with timestamps.",

      {
        "if": "The contract hides maintenance fees or makes them hard to compute.",

          "Convert maintenance to a per-day cost and compare it to expected revenue.",
          "Stress-test with lower DOGE/LTC prices and higher difficulty.",
          "If maintenance can exceed revenue in the base case, skip the contract."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The provider can’t prove operations (pool ties, live hashrate, payout ledger).",
        "then": [
          "Request verifiable pool accounts, real-time hashrate metrics, and payout tx evidence.",
          "Avoid stock-photo “data centers” and anonymous team pages.",
          "Prefer providers with consistent, on-chain, independently checkable payouts."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You mainly want DOGE exposure rather than mining experience.",
        "then": [
          "Consider spot buying or periodic purchases instead of renting hash rate.",
          "Compare the expected mining net yield to simply holding DOGE.",
          "Choose the path with fewer counterparty and fee risks."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Merged mining means you’re effectively renting Scrypt hash rate that often yields both LTC and DOGE via pool payouts.",
    "Maintenance fees compound and can erase returns during flat or bearish markets.",
    "Difficulty drift reduces coins per MH/s over time—even if your hash rate stays constant.",
    "Counterparty risk is the core risk: you depend on a third party to operate and pay.",
    "Avoid over-committing: size contracts so a total loss wouldn’t harm your finances."

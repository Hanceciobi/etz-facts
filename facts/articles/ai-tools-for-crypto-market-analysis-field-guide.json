    "Which datasets matter most for crypto market analysis (price, microstructure, derivatives, on-chain, sentiment)?",

    "What execution choices matter most in live crypto markets (routing, slippage, TWAP/VWAP)?",
    "How do you monitor model health and detect regime shifts before performance collapses?",
    "What’s a practical checklist to move from notebooks to a stable trading stack?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with clean, timestamped data and a realistic backtest that includes fees, slippage, and latency.",
    "Blend signal types: price/microstructure, derivatives, on-chain flows, and sentiment—then validate out of sample.",
    "Build risk first: volatility-aware sizing, correlation controls, and a clear kill-switch playbook.",
    "Treat execution as part of the edge: routing, spreads, and scheduled execution often beat “smarter” models.",
    "Monitor live drift and retrain on a schedule; update strategies when regimes change."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Leakage and survivorship bias can make weak models look brilliant; strict time discipline is non-negotiable.",
    "Execution and costs are often the difference between profit and disappointment—model edge can evaporate at the fill.",
    "Markets are non-stationary; plan retraining/decay like maintenance, not a one-off setup.",
    "Operational risk matters: feed delays, outages, and silent drift need dashboards and rollback paths."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Define how much anonymity you really need, what is legal in your country, and what trade-offs with speed and convenience you accept.",
    "Set up a fresh non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, generate a new receiving address, and store the seed phrase safely offline.",
    "Choose a low-friction way to get into crypto that fits your risk tolerance, such as a small KYC purchase, vouchers, or income paid in crypto.",
    "Convert that value into Bitcoin through a reputable non-custodial no-KYC swap instead of ad-hoc P2P deals or custodial exchange balances.",
    "Keep your Bitcoin privacy over time with address rotation, separate wallets for savings and spending, and cautious exits to KYC rails when needed."

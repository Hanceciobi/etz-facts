    "How do I know I downloaded the real wallet app?",
    "Fake wallet app vs fake update — what’s the difference?",
    "How do I verify the official domain, store listing, and publisher?",
    "Do real wallet updates ever ask for a seed phrase or recovery words?",
    "How can I verify a desktop wallet download using release notes and hashes?",
    "What should I do if I entered my seed phrase into a suspicious wallet?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Freeze: don’t click “update” links from ads, DMs, pop-ups, or random blogs.",
    "Open the official site the boring way: bookmark or typed domain, then follow official store/release links only.",
    "Confirm publisher identity: developer name and listing must match what the official site shows.",
    "If recovery words were entered: assume compromise and migrate funds to a new seed on a clean device.",
    "Lock the habit: bookmarks over search, official channels over chats, clean browser profile for installs."

          "Treat the seed as compromised (cannot be made safe again)",
          "Create a brand-new wallet with a fresh seed on a clean device",
          "Move assets to new addresses as soon as practical",
          "Stop using the exposed wallet and avoid ‘support’ DMs or recovery offers"

      {
        "if": "Remote access tools were installed or the device behaves oddly",
        "then": [
          "Prioritize moving funds using a clean device and a new seed",
          "Backup essentials and reinstall the OS / factory reset if practical",
          "Rebuild a clean setup: fresh browser profile, minimal extensions, official bookmarks"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Sponsored links and search ads can route to look-alike domains that mimic official download pages.",
    "A legitimate wallet update does not require your seed phrase or recovery words.",
    "APK/EXE downloads shared in chats are a common malware path; prefer official store listings and signed releases.",
    "Attackers may delay draining funds after seed exposure; migration to a new seed reduces the risk window.",
    "Copycat apps often differ by tiny publisher-name spelling, domain characters, or extra words like “Pro/Official/2026”."

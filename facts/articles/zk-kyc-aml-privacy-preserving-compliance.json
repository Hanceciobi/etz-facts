  "quickSteps": [
    "Define the exact policy statements you want to prove (age, residency, sanctions, limits, freshness).",
    "Choose attesters and credential formats, then model proofs as commitments + selective disclosure.",
    "Design revocation and list updates (rolling commitments, refresh cadence, grace windows).",
    "Ship with audited circuits/contracts and replay-resistant nullifiers.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "ZK proves statements about data; it doesn’t replace legal obligations or eliminate enforcement risk.",
    "Dynamic lists and revocation are the hardest parts—design them before scaling user volume.",
    "Circuit and contract bugs can be catastrophic; audited libraries and change management are mandatory.",
    "Bad UX breaks privacy: users will screenshot, paste, or reuse proofs—build clear, safe flows by default."

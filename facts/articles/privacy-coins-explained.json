    "What makes a coin “private,” and what does it actually hide?",
    "How do the main privacy techniques work (rings, stealth addresses, zk-proofs, CoinJoin)?",
    "What’s the difference between pseudonymity and anonymity in practice?",
    "Which legitimate use cases benefit from stronger payment privacy?",
    "Where do privacy failures still happen (metadata, KYC edges, address reuse)?",
    "How are regulation and privacy-preserving compliance likely to evolve next?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Use self-custody wallets and store your seed offline (no screenshots or cloud notes).",
    "Avoid address reuse and separate contexts by purpose with subaddresses or separate wallets.",
    "Plan for edge metadata: clean devices, cautious connectivity, and less public tx sharing.",
    "Keep private records for taxes/compliance without broadcasting your activity publicly.",
    "Understand the trade-offs: liquidity, UX, and policy friction vary by coin and region.",
    "Use privacy to minimize unnecessary exposure—not to evade legitimate obligations."

          "Assume KYC entry/exit points can anchor identity; plan around that reality.",
          "Avoid tight, unique-amount sequences (deposit → swap → withdraw) when possible.",
          "Reduce oversharing (txids, screenshots, timestamps) that can create linkability."

        "if": "You need selective disclosure for accounting or audits.",
        "then": [
          "Prefer tools that support ‘prove just enough’ (viewing keys or structured exports).",
          "Share disclosures only with trusted parties and limit scope and duration.",
          "Keep documentation private rather than posting it publicly."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Protocol privacy doesn’t protect you from metadata leaks (IP, timing, KYC edges, chats).",
    "Liquidity can be thinner in some markets; large trades may face slippage.",
    "Wallet UX matters: poor defaults or user mistakes can undo strong cryptography.",
    "Policy and platform support vary by jurisdiction; expect uneven access over time.",
    "Security basics (seed storage, phishing resistance) often matter more than advanced tricks."

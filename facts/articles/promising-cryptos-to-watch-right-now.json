    "Look for ecosystem strength: developers, tooling, integrations, and liquidity.",
    "Size positions using a risk budget; avoid leverage unless you fully understand liquidation risk.",
    "Use strong custody hygiene: hardware wallets for long-term holds, test recovery, and keep clean backups."

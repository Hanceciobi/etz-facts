  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “sentiment” mean in crypto, and why does it move price so quickly?",
    "Which sentiment signals are most useful (social, derivatives, on-chain, attention)?",
    "How do you separate unique interest from repeated noise and bot amplification?",
    "How can you use sentiment without getting trapped by narratives and crowding?",
    "How do you protect your informational footprint while rotating positions?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with a thesis, then use sentiment as a wind check—not a standalone strategy.",
    "Track social + derivatives + on-chain together: unique voices, funding, skew, and flows.",
    "Size smaller when signals are loud and late; scale only when evidence stays aligned.",
    "Pre-write exits using objective thresholds (funding, inflows, skew flips).",
    "Protect privacy and metadata: keep routes simple, custody short, and data sharing minimal."

    "start": "I want to use sentiment signals without becoming exit liquidity",

      {
        "if": "I’m trading short-term moves and want cleaner entries",
        "then": [
          "Prefer early, aligned signals: unique accounts rising + neutral funding + steady volume",
          "Avoid chasing extreme funding and euphoric language; wait for better entries",

          "Treat sentiment extremes as caution flags; reduce size and tighten risk",
          "Confirm with positioning proxies (funding, basis, skew) and liquidity conditions",
          "Avoid forcing trades when time windows and congestion are hostile"

      },
      {
        "if": "I care about privacy and strategy leakage while rotating",
        "then": [
          "Minimize unnecessary identity exposure; don’t share what isn’t required",
          "Keep research and execution hygiene separate where practical",
          "Prefer routes that reduce metadata exhaust when privacy matters"

  "riskNotes": [
    "Sentiment tools are binoculars, not trading systems—use them with risk limits, not vibes.",
    "Bots, sarcasm, and selection bias can break naive sentiment models—cross-check independent sources.",
    "Reflexivity can double-count directionality: rising price can cause positive sentiment, not only the reverse.",
    "Protect your footprint: avoid over-sharing routes and timing if privacy or strategy matters."

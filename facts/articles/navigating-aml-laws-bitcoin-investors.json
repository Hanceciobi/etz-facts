  "quickSteps": [
    "Use reputable, compliant platforms for fiat on/off ramps and keep a backup account.",
    "Keep basic records (deposits, withdrawals, trades) in exports, not screenshots.",
    "Label large transfers with a short purpose note and retain supporting documents.",
    "Expect Travel Rule checks for larger VASP-to-VASP transfers; plan for them.",
    "Keep self-custody for savings and separate wallets by purpose.",
    "Answer compliance questions quickly, clearly, and with minimal necessary proof."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Most AML “alerts” are routine checks; clear documentation resolves them faster.",
    "Posting addresses, tx links, or screenshots publicly can create permanent linkability.",
    "Mixing unrelated activities in one wallet makes your story harder to explain.",
    "Travel Rule implementations differ by country and provider; plan for variability.",
    "Chasing “KYC-dodge” products often increases risk and scrutiny rather than reducing it."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does Monero hide by default, and what can still leak outside the chain?",
    "What is RingCT, and how does it hide amounts and the true input?",
    "Why do stealth addresses prevent recipient linkage and address reuse on-chain?",
    "What is a view key, and how does it enable audits without spending power?",
    "How do payment proofs work and when do you actually need them?",
    "Which everyday habits preserve privacy better than “advanced” tricks?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Use a reputable XMR wallet and store your seed offline (no photos or cloud notes).",
    "Use subaddresses to organize flows by purpose without creating on-chain reuse patterns.",
    "Confirm restore height to speed up syncing and reduce confusion when scanning.",
    "Keep transaction keys/private proofs only when you’ll need to prove a specific payment.",
    "Share view access only when required, via trusted channels, and revoke when done.",
    "Protect metadata: careful connectivity, clean devices, and no public txid oversharing."

          "Use a view-only wallet instead of screenshots or ad-hoc exports.",
          "Share the view key only with a trusted party and document the scope.",

      {
        "if": "You’re worried about linkability outside the chain.",
        "then": [
          "Avoid posting txids, times, and amounts in public chats or social posts.",
          "Use safer connectivity when needed (trusted nodes and privacy-aware routing).",
          "Keep separate wallets/contexts for unrelated activities."

      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Monero hides on-chain details, but network metadata and off-chain touchpoints can still reveal context.",
    "Sharing view keys widely increases exposure; scope access and treat it as sensitive.",
    "Public disclosures (txids, timestamps, amounts) can undo privacy even if the chain is private.",
    "Device compromise and clipboard malware can leak more than the blockchain ever would.",
    "Operational hygiene and clear routines matter more than “clever” tricks."

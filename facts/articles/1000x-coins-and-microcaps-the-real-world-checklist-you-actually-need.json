    "riskNotes": [
      "Microcap coins combine thin liquidity, concentrated holdings and aggressive unlock schedules, which can turn small narrative shifts into severe drawdowns.",
      "Survivorship bias around past 1000x winners hides the far larger set of projects that died quietly after early pumps.",
      "AI tools can speed up research but cannot replace human judgement; blindly following AI-generated picks turns due diligence into another form of gambling.",
      "Non-custodial swaps reduce custody risk and help with execution, but they do not remove protocol, tokenomics or market structure risks."
    ],
    "keyTakeaways": [
      "FDV, real liquidity depth, vesting schedules and listing venues matter more for microcaps than memes or short-term hype.",
      "Red flags cluster around opaque tokenomics, extreme insider allocations, vanishing liquidity and purely promotional social channels.",
      "A simple pre-trade drilldown across documentation, block explorers, social channels and code activity can filter out many obvious traps.",
      "AI is best used as an assistant for summarising, stress-testing tokenomics and writing risk memos, not as an oracle for 1000x picks.",
      "Services like ETZ only make sense once a token has basic trading depth; they are execution tools, not sources of alpha."

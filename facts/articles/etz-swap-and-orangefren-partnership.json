    "Directory discovery and swap execution are separate: confirm what OrangeFren provides vs what ETZ-Swap executes.",
    "Filters reduce risk, but they don’t eliminate it—verify assumptions like fees, timing, and network conditions.",
    "Guarantee programs apply only to selected listings and specific cases; read the terms before relying on it.",
    "Avoid sharing unnecessary personal data when researching routes; keep operational hygiene simple and consistent."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "Is “Base ETH” a different coin, or just ETH on an L2 network?",
    "How do Base (L2) and Ethereum mainnet (L1) split execution vs settlement?",
    "Why are fees typically lower on Base, and when can they rise?",
    "What does “finality” mean on L2 vs L1, especially for withdrawals?",
    "What extra trust assumptions come with an optimistic rollup (sequencer, fraud proofs, upgrades)?",
    "When should builders and users prefer L1, and when does Base make more sense?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide what matters most: maximum settlement assurances (L1) or low fees + speed (L2).",
    "For routine activity, use Base; for high-value settlement, keep critical moves on L1.",
    "Budget for withdrawals: canonical exits may take days; liquidity bridges can be faster with added risk/fees.",
    "Verify contract addresses and token versions per network (L1 vs Base).",
    "Track bridge tx hashes + L2 tx hashes for operations and accounting.",
    "Keep a fallback route documented (alternate bridge or direct rails)."

        "then": [
          "Prefer Ethereum mainnet (L1) for the critical transaction.",
          "Use L2 only for ancillary steps and keep bridging optional.",

        "then": [
          "Use Base for day-to-day activity and onboarding.",
          "Expect near-instant local confirmations for UX.",
          "Keep a small L1 buffer for emergencies and bridge fees."

      {

        "then": [
          "Anchor critical state/governance on L1; put user interactions on Base.",
          "Maintain per-network address books and deployment checklists.",
          "Monitor sequencer/proof systems and publish an incident runbook."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "L2 UX finality is fast, but L1-level settlement depends on batching and dispute periods.",
    "Optimistic rollups add assumptions: sequencer behavior, fraud-proof availability, and upgrade policies.",
    "Asset names can look identical across networks; token representations and contract addresses may differ.",
    "Fast exits via liquidity bridges can reduce latency but add smart-contract and liquidity risk.",
    "Operational hygiene (records, address books, incident readiness) matters as much as technology."

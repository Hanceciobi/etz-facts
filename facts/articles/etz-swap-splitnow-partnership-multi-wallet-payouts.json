    "What is SplitNOW and why would I want a swap to land in multiple wallets?",
    "How does a single swap turn into payouts to several recipient addresses?",
    "Is a multi-wallet payout safer than doing multiple manual sends after a swap?",
    "What extra fees or network costs should I expect with multi-wallet distribution?",
    "What should I do if one recipient address did not receive the payout?",
    "How do I avoid “support” scams when something looks delayed or confusing?"

  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide why each wallet exists before you create the split.",
    "Start with a small test amount on the same network you plan to use.",
    "Prepare recipient addresses directly inside your wallet apps and double-check them.",
    "Keep your execution environment clean and refuse any remote “help.”",

  "riskNotes": [
    "A multi-wallet payout reduces repetitive manual sends, but it does not remove the need to verify every address and network.",
    "Expect routing and network fees to affect final per-wallet amounts; always confirm results after completion.",
    "Never accept support through DMs, screen sharing, or remote-access tools; use official channels only.",
    "Do not copy recipient addresses from chats or screenshots; take them directly from your wallet apps and double-check.",
    "If you entered a wrong address, blockchain transfers are typically irreversible—slow down and verify before you submit."

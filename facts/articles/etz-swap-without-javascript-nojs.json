  "keyQuestions": [
    "Is a no-JavaScript website safer for crypto swaps?",
    "What risks are reduced when a swap flow works without client-side scripts?",
    "Will the no-JS version work with Tor, NoScript, or hardened browsers?",
    "Does disabling JavaScript stop tracking and fingerprinting?",
    "Is the no-JS site faster and more reliable on slow devices or networks?",
    "How should I verify deposit and payout status when the UI is minimal?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Use the official no-JS site at https://nojs.etz-swap.com and verify the domain carefully before entering any addresses.",
    "Treat the network as part of the asset name and double-check networks before sending, especially for stablecoins like USDT.",
    "If your browser setup is strict or new, start with a small test amount to confirm the flow before sending larger funds.",
    "Verify deposit and payout using TXIDs in a block explorer and confirmation counts, not only on-page status indicators.",
    "If anything feels inconsistent, stop: do not rush, re-check details, and only proceed when the basics match."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "If something goes wrong, do not send additional funds. First collect the facts (asset, network, amount, TXIDs, time) and verify on-chain status.",

          "Refresh the page and try again on a stable connection.",
          "Check whether your browser blocks cookies or form submissions and adjust settings if needed.",
          "Try another hardened browser profile or device for the same no-JS domain.",
          "If the issue persists, use the main site and compare the required fields, then return to the no-JS flow."

          "Verify the deposit TXID and confirmation count in a block explorer.",
          "If the deposit is confirmed, look for the payout TXID or output transaction on-chain.",
          "If on-chain status is correct but the UI still does not reflect it, contact support with TXIDs and swap details."

      {
        "if": "The swap completed but funds are not visible in your wallet",
        "then": [
          "Confirm the receiving address and the correct network in your wallet.",
          "Check the payout TXID in a block explorer and verify the destination address matches yours.",
          "Refresh the wallet, re-scan, or ensure the correct network is selected for display.",
          "If the payout TXID shows a different address, contact support with the deposit TXID and the receiving address you entered."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "No-JS reduces reliance on client-side scripts, which can lower certain browser-side risks and improve stability in hardened environments.",
    "It does not make you invisible: network-level signals and on-chain visibility still exist.",
    "Typos and lookalike domains are a common threat; always verify https://nojs.etz-swap.com before proceeding.",
    "Network mix-ups remain a leading cause of failed swaps, especially for stablecoins that exist on multiple chains.",
    "Minimal UI does not replace verification: always confirm deposits and payouts by TXID and confirmation counts."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is EigenWallet?",
    "How is EigenWallet different from an exchange account?",
    "What does the ETZ Swap and EigenWallet partnership change for users?",
    "How do I avoid fake wallet downloads and fake support?",
    "What info is safe to share if something goes wrong?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Verify before you download: use the official EigenWallet site and trusted links, not ads, DMs, or forwarded pages.",
    "Keep roles clear: swap on ETZ Swap, then move XMR into a self-custody routine in EigenWallet.",
    "Back up recovery words offline once and never type them into anything for “verification,” “sync,” or “support.”",
    "If you need help, share only safe details (TXID, network, time, redacted errors) and never share keys or allow remote access.",
    "If you suspect compromise, create a fresh wallet on a clean device and migrate funds to a new recovery phrase immediately."
  ],
  "riskNotes": [
    "This partnership improves the swap-to-storage flow but does not eliminate security risk; users must still verify downloads and channels.",
    "Self-custody means there is no password reset; recovery words and private keys must never be shared with anyone.",
    "Fake wallet downloads and support impersonation are common; avoid search ads and verify channels from official websites.",
    "After any swap, storage hygiene (offline backups, clean devices, minimal extensions) often matters more than the swap step itself.",
    "If recovery words were exposed, the only safe response is migrating funds to a new wallet seed on a clean device."

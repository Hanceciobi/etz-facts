  "keyQuestions": [
    "What problem is Layer Brett (Lbrett) trying to solve in real-world blockchain usage?",
    "How do “layers” help scale blockchains without sacrificing security?",
    "What factors tend to move Lbrett’s market price: adoption, updates, liquidity, or regulation?",
    "How can you read a price chart without overreacting to short-term noise?",
    "What practical steps reduce mistakes when exploring new ecosystems and tokens?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with the fundamentals: what Lbrett does, who it serves, and why it’s needed.",
    "Check how it integrates with existing chains and where it actually adds scalability.",
    "Watch adoption signals (developers, apps, usage) alongside liquidity and volume.",
    "Use staged execution and a risk budget; avoid leverage into early volatility.",
    "Keep security basics tight: verify links, double-check networks, and test small transfers first."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Begin with the use case (scalability, fees, compatibility, sustainability). Then decide whether you’re evaluating the tech, trading the token, or using the ecosystem.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You’re evaluating Lbrett as a technology",
        "then": [
          "Focus on throughput, fees, security assumptions, and compatibility claims.",
          "Look for measurable progress: released tooling, integrations, and real usage."

      {
        "if": "You’re evaluating Lbrett as a market asset",
        "then": [
          "Separate fundamentals from hype; treat early price moves as high uncertainty.",
          "Prioritize liquidity, spreads, and execution conditions before sizing up."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You plan to use the ecosystem",
        "then": [
          "Confirm the correct network and token details before interacting with apps.",
          "Minimize risk by starting small and keeping long-term holdings separate."

    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Early-stage ecosystems can be volatile; adoption narratives can change quickly.",
    "Liquidity and spreads can widen unexpectedly, making execution costlier than expected.",
    "Most avoidable losses come from operational mistakes: wrong network, unverified links, or unsafe signing behavior."

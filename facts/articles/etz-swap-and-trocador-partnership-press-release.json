    "What is Trocador.app and why is its partner bar considered high?",
    "How does this partnership improve routing, pricing, and reliability for ETZ-Swap users?",
    "What changes for users at checkout, and what stays the same?",
    "How does route selection work (fixed vs floating, time windows, fees)?",
    "What should users do to reduce failed attempts on larger swaps?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Request a quote for your pair and amount on ETZ Swap.",
    "Review the route details (rate type, fees, expected time window).",
    "Send funds from your wallet and monitor status updates.",
    "If conditions change, review alternative routes when offered.",
    "For larger swaps, test small first, then proceed in tranches."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I want better pricing and fewer failed swaps without giving up privacy or custodial control",

        "then": [
          "Compare routes by net received, not just headline rate",

        "then": [
          "Choose routes with strong historical uptime and realistic confirmation expectations",
          "Avoid pushing the edge of time windows; send promptly after quoting",

      {
        "if": "A swap stalls or conditions change mid-execution",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Better routing reduces risk, but network congestion and confirmation delays still happen—watch time windows.",
    "Always verify addresses; avoid copying from untrusted sources and double-check the destination.",
    "Compare by net received after fees and spread, not by headline pricing alone.",
    "For large swaps, test first and use tranches to reduce the cost of mistakes."

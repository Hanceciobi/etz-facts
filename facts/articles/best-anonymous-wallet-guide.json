    "What does “anonymous wallet” really mean in crypto—pseudonymity or strong privacy?",
    "Which must-have features matter most for real-world privacy and security?",
    "When do you need coin control and labeling, and how do they prevent linkage?",
    "What transport privacy options (Tor, nodes, telemetry) should you look for?",
    "How should you compare mobile, desktop, hardware, and web wallets for your threat model?",
    "What daily habits keep you private even when the wallet is “good enough” on paper?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with self-custody: keys generated locally, seed stored offline, no cloud screenshots.",
    "Choose wallets that rotate addresses and handle change safely; avoid address reuse.",
    "Prefer coin control + labeling when available to prevent accidental mixing/linkage.",
    "Enable Tor (or equivalent) and minimize telemetry; keep devices clean and updated.",
    "Use hardware signing for larger balances and test recovery before going big.",
    "Keep private records for accounting/taxes without posting tx context publicly."

          "Mobile: convenient for spending, but keep balances small and apps minimal.",
          "Desktop: best for coin control and records; pair with hardware for safety.",
          "Hardware: best for savings; still needs good software privacy defaults.",
          "Web wallets: avoid for privacy unless you fully understand custody trade-offs."

  "riskNotes": [
    "No wallet is a magic cloak: privacy depends on habits (reuse, screenshots, device hygiene).",
    "Transport metadata (IP/RPC endpoints) can leak context even when the chain is private.",
    "Fake apps and look-alike domains are common—verify publishers and sources.",
    "Coin mixing and advanced features help only if you understand the trade-offs and defaults.",
    "Keep your own records for compliance; privacy is data minimization, not “no paperwork.”"

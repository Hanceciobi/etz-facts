  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “liquidity” mean in crypto in practical terms?",
    "How do market depth, spreads, and slippage interact during execution?",
    "What are the key differences between CEX order books and DEX pools for liquidity?",
    "Which pre-trade checks reduce hidden costs the most?",
    "How can you size and route orders to avoid walking the book or spiking price impact?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Check spread and visible size near the midpoint for your pair and venue.",
    "Simulate your swap size (or look at depth within 1–2%) before executing.",
    "Prefer major quote assets and venues/pools with consistent, reputable volume.",
    "Split large orders into smaller clips and avoid illiquid hours where possible.",
    "Record realized slippage for your typical size to learn the best execution windows."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your order size and pick the venue/path that offers the tightest spread and the most depth close to price. If impact rises quickly, split the order or route via aggregators.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Your order moves the price or fills far from the quote",
        "then": [
          "Reduce clip size and execute in slices, allowing the book/pool to refill.",
          "Switch to a deeper venue or a major stable/BTC/ETH-quoted market."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "On-chain quotes show large price impact for modest swaps",
        "then": [
          "Route through an aggregator across multiple pools and fee tiers.",
          "Wait for lower gas/less congestion, or use a chain where execution is cheaper."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Liquidity depends on one venue or incentive program",
        "then": [
          "Diversify execution paths and avoid assuming yesterday’s depth will persist.",
          "Monitor for incentive cliffs and sudden TVL/volume drops."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Liquidity is dynamic; spreads and depth can change quickly with volatility, congestion, or venue outages.",
    "Printed volume can be misleading; prioritize consistent, reputable liquidity over vanity metrics.",
    "Most avoidable execution losses come from market orders in thin books/pools and from trading during illiquid windows."

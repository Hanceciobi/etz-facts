  "quickSteps": [
    "Choose your priority (rate, speed, or lower identity friction) before comparing routes.",
    "Compare routes in one place to reduce tab-hopping and avoid rushed decisions.",
    "Pick a provider with clear expectations and don’t ignore route warnings.",
    "Confirm network, address, and memo/tag requirements before you send funds.",
    "If something goes wrong, share only public swap details and follow official support paths."
  ],
  "riskNotes": [
    "Route comparison improves decision context but does not eliminate transaction risk.",
    "A lower likelihood of verification is not a guarantee; edge cases can trigger extra checks depending on provider policies.",
    "Most user losses happen from wrong links, wrong networks, or rushed decisions—use bookmarks and confirm details before sending.",
    "Never share a seed phrase or allow remote access, even if someone claims to be support."

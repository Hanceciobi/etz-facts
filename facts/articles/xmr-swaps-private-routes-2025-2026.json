  "quickSteps": [
    "Map the full route before you move anything: where the funds start, where the XMR segment sits, which asset you exit into, and who sees each leg of the path.",
    "Separate roles, devices, and timing: keep KYC accounts, private wallets, and test amounts on distinct profiles and avoid running every swap as an instant mirror.",
    "Shape amounts and networks so they blend in: prefer liquid pairs, avoid highly unique sums, and rehearse any new route with a small swap first.",
    "Use non-custodial tools with transparent behaviour: clear timers, understandable fees, predictable payouts, and human support you can actually reach.",
    "After the swap, contain and clean up: move long-term XMR into safer storage, revoke unneeded approvals, rotate addresses if needed, and keep only minimal private notes for yourself."

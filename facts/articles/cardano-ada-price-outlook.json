  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is Cardano in simple terms, and what drives demand for ADA?",
    "How does Ouroboros proof-of-stake work, and what does delegation actually do?",
    "Which adoption signals matter most for ADA’s long-term price trajectory?",
    "How should you read price predictions without getting misled by single-number targets?",
    "What are the biggest risks (volatility, competition, regulation, delivery speed)?",
    "What practical risk management steps make sense for long-term ADA holders?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Define your time horizon and risk budget; size ADA so drawdowns won’t break your plan.",
    "Learn the basics with a small test: wallet setup, a transfer, and (if you choose) delegation.",
    "Track real traction: app usage, stablecoin depth, bridge reliability, and shipping cadence.",
    "Think in scenarios (conservative/base/upside) rather than believing fixed price targets.",
    "Avoid leverage and stagger entries to reduce timing risk.",
    "Review quarterly: add, hold, or exit based on execution and adoption—not headlines."

    "start": "I’m considering ADA for a long-term hold — how do I evaluate it without hype?",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You’re new to Cardano and want the basics.",
        "then": [
          "Understand the two-layer mental model (settlement vs computation).",
          "Learn how staking delegation works and how rewards relate to network security.",
          "Do a small real transaction so the UX is not theoretical."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re trying to judge whether price can grow sustainably.",
        "then": [
          "Watch on-chain activity and app quality that real users can adopt.",
          "Track stablecoin/bridge depth and reliability (rails for everyday use).",
          "Look for throughput under peak demand rather than marketing TPS numbers."

      },
      {
        "if": "You’re worried about risk and volatility.",
        "then": [
          "Avoid leverage and use staged entries over time.",
          "Set rules for rebalancing if ADA grows too large relative to your portfolio.",
          "Define what would break your thesis (security incidents, stalled shipping, shrinking usage)."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You need a practical holding routine.",
        "then": [
          "Use self-custody with offline seed backups and test recovery early.",
          "Keep your records for accounting without oversharing tx context publicly.",
          "Review your thesis on a schedule; don’t chase short-term narratives."

    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "ADA is volatile; position sizing matters more than “conviction.”",
    "A research-led pace can reduce bugs but may lag faster-shipping competitors.",
    "Liquidity and macro cycles can dominate fundamentals for long stretches.",
    "Regulatory changes around staking or token classifications can shift access and demand.",
    "Real-world adoption is the key driver; treat long-range price targets as storytelling."

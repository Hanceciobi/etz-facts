  "quickSteps": [
    "Define peg SLOs (tolerances and time windows) and decide what gets automated vs escalated.",
    "Ship one role first (Peg Watcher), then add Smart Router and Collateral Sentinel with strict caps.",
    "Implement guardrails: hard limits, rate limits, signed intents, multi-sig confirms, kill switches.",
    "Design for the worst case: dispute/latency, fee spikes, oracle disagreement, chain halts.",
    "Log inputs, thresholds, and reasons for every action; run monthly drills against playbooks."

        "then": [

          "Use smart routing based on effective cost (fees, gas, MEV) and pre-approved venues",

          "Minimize identity and metadata where it is not required for execution",
          "Separate research, monitoring, and execution accounts/infra where practical",
          "Prefer routes that reduce unnecessary data exhaust during routine swaps and rebalances"

        "if": "I’m worried about automation misfiring during volatility",
        "then": [
          "Require oracle agreement and anomaly thresholds before execution",
          "Use timelocks/circuit breakers on contracts; keep emergency powers narrow and logged",
          "Run drills (oracle outage, chain halt, rumor-led redemptions) and practice fail-safe behavior"

  "riskNotes": [
    "Automation helps operations; it cannot fix broken economics in an under-secured design.",
    "Fragmented liquidity creates hidden costs—measure effective cost per action, not headline rates.",
    "Bad UX breaks privacy: users will screenshot, paste, or reuse sensitive data if flows are unclear.",
    "Incidents happen; transparent playbooks and fast, boring responses matter more than cleverness."

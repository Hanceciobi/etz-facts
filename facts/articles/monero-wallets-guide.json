    "What everyday habits keep XMR safer against phishing, fake downloads, and device compromise?",
    "Which beginner mistakes put recovery phrases or funds at risk, and how do you avoid them?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Choose the right wallet type for your risk level: hardware for long-term, mobile for daily use.",
    "Download only from verified sources, then create a new wallet and record the seed phrase offline.",
    "Lock access with a strong password and keep your device updated and protected.",
    "Test with a small transfer before moving larger balances or relying on the wallet.",
    "Split holdings: spending wallet for routine use, cold storage for reserves, and keep backups offline."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your goal (holding, spending, or occasional access). Pick the wallet type that matches your threat model, then secure the recovery phrase before you fund the wallet.",

          "Use a reputable mobile wallet and keep only a small spending balance there.",

      {

        "then": [
          "Use web wallets only for small balances and short-term needs.",
          "Assume higher trust in external infrastructure and compensate with lower exposure."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Your recovery phrase is the real key: screenshots, cloud storage, or email backups can compromise funds.",
    "Fake wallet downloads and phishing are common; verify sources and URLs every time.",
    "Wallet choice is a trade-off between control and convenience—size exposure to match that trade-off."

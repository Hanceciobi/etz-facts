  "keyQuestions": [
    "What counts as an RWA on-chain, and what is just marketing?",
    "Why are stablecoins still the biggest RWA by far, and what does that imply?",
    "How do tokenized Treasuries work in practice (wrappers, custody, redemption)?",
    "What are the real risks: issuer, legal enforceability, oracle, and smart contract failure modes?",
    "How can builders ship RWA products without creating compliance and privacy disasters?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with the wrapper: understand the issuer, custodian, audits, and redemption terms before you touch the token.",
    "Check transfer rules (KYC/whitelists) and jurisdiction limits; RWAs are often permissioned by design.",
    "Measure outcomes, not vibes: liquidity depth, settlement SLAs, and incident history beat TVL headlines.",
    "Diversify dependencies: avoid concentrating large balances in one issuer, one custodian, or one protocol.",
    "Keep privacy hygiene: separate identities, share the minimum required data, and document compliance flows."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I want RWA exposure that behaves like a real financial product, not a narrative trade",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "I’m an investor choosing between stablecoins, tokenized Treasuries, and private credit",
        "then": [
          "Compare wrappers: issuer, custody, audit cadence, and redemption restrictions",
          "Prefer clear reserve reporting and conservative asset quality",
          "Evaluate liquidity realistically: who can trade, where, and under which transfer rules"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "I’m building an RWA product and need a practical launch path",
        "then": [
          "Do legal and custody first (SPV/fund docs, manager responsibilities, compliance pipeline)",
          "Add on-chain controls (whitelists, pause/burn where lawful) and budget for audits",
          "Ship a familiar UX: investors expect fund-like flows, not DeFi puzzles"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "My biggest worry is regulation and privacy leakage",
        "then": [
          "Design for minimal disclosure and strong access control around sensitive data",
          "Document due-process access paths instead of blanket surveillance",
          "Avoid mixing public DeFi activity and fully compliant RWA holdings in one identity"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "RWAs are not trustless: you still rely on issuers, custodians, and legal enforceability.",
    "Redemption terms and transfer restrictions can turn ‘liquidity’ into a mirage—read the fine print.",
    "Oracles and NAV reporting are critical; weak data hygiene breaks the product even if the asset is solid.",
    "Protocol tokens are not the underlying asset; governance upside can diverge from RWA growth."

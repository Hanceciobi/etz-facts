    "How can DCA, rebalancing, and hedging fit into a single plan?",
    "What should you do in the first 72 hours of a major selloff?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Pause before acting; separate liquidity stress from fundamental impairment.",
    "Map exposures and liquidation risks (loans, perps, options, yield positions).",
    "Execute with limits and staged orders; respect thin books and slippage.",
    "Use pre-set DCA tranches and rebalancing bands instead of emotional buys/sells.",
    "Rebuild optionality: restore cash buffers and tighten security after volatility spikes."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start by stabilizing custody and access, then identify the single biggest failure mode (forced liquidation, counterparty risk, or bad execution) and neutralize it first.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You have leverage or collateralized loans",
        "then": [
          "Calculate liquidation thresholds and reduce exposure before volatility accelerates.",

        "if": "You are unleveraged but exposed to concentrated risk",
        "then": [
          "Rebalance toward target weights using bands instead of impulse trades.",
          "Upgrade quality: keep assets with durable fundamentals, exit broken theses."

      {
        "if": "You want protection without liquidating core holdings",
        "then": [
          "Use defined-budget hedges (partial short futures or option structures) sized to risk, not fear.",
          "Set expiry/roll rules so protection doesn’t decay unnoticed."

    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Crashes can combine thin liquidity and forced liquidations; execution quality often matters as much as direction.",
    "Counterparty failures and rehypothecation risk tend to surface during stress; diversify venues and prioritize self-custody.",
    "Over-trading headlines and averaging down without re-underwriting fundamentals are common, avoidable mistakes."

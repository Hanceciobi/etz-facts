  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is PGP and why is it still relevant for privacy in 2025?",
    "How does hybrid encryption combine symmetric and public-key cryptography?",
    "What are digital signatures and what do they actually prove?",
    "Which modern tools make PGP usable without deep technical skills?",
    "How should you manage keys safely to avoid losing access or leaking secrets?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Generate a key pair and protect your private key with a strong passphrase.",
    "Share only your public key and verify fingerprints via a trusted channel.",
    "Encrypt messages/files for the recipient and sign important data you send.",
    "Back up keys securely (offline when possible) and keep revocation info ready.",
    "Update tools regularly and rotate keys when standards or risks change."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start by deciding what you need: encrypted email, file encryption, or signatures for verification. Then pick a tool that fits your device and workflow, and lock down key storage before you share anything.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You mainly need secure email",
        "then": [
          "Use a mail plugin or web extension and practice with test messages first.",
          "Verify public key fingerprints before trusting a new contact."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You mainly need to protect files and backups",
        "then": [
          "Encrypt archives locally and keep the private key offline when possible.",
          "Create a recovery plan so you don’t lose access to long-term data."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You need authenticity and tamper-proof publishing",
        "then": [
          "Sign releases, documents, or messages and publish your public key fingerprint.",
          "Teach recipients how to verify signatures, not just how to decrypt."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "PGP security depends on key management; leaked private keys or weak passphrases negate encryption.",
    "Trust is social as much as technical; fingerprint verification prevents impostor keys.",
    "Complexity is manageable with modern tools, but onboarding and habits still matter."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "Why are most cryptocurrencies pseudonymous rather than anonymous?",
    "How do investigators cluster addresses and trace flows across transactions?",
    "Where do off-chain breadcrumbs (KYC records, OSINT, IP data) enter the picture?",
    "What do privacy coins change, and where do their limits still show up?",
    "What practical habits improve privacy without relying on myths?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Assume transparency by default: public chains expose a permanent transaction graph.",
    "Avoid address reuse and careless change handling; use wallets with strong hygiene features.",
    "Reduce off-chain leakage: don’t post addresses/TxIDs, and avoid screenshots of sensitive flows.",
    "Protect network metadata (VPN/Tor where appropriate) and minimize unnecessary telemetry.",
    "If you need stronger on-chain confidentiality, learn the trade-offs of default-private assets and good operational practice."

          "Avoid toggling between transparent and private pools without understanding linkage risk",

      {
        "if": "My biggest risk is metadata (devices, IP, and off-chain traces)",
        "then": [
          "Separate research and execution where practical",
          "Use VPN/Tor and reduce browser fingerprinting and DNS leakage",

  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Public ledgers are transparent; anonymity depends on behavior and surrounding infrastructure, not addresses alone.",
    "Mixing techniques can raise analysis cost, but post-mix behavior can re-link funds.",
    "Privacy tooling is dual-use; follow local law and avoid claims of ‘guaranteed anonymity’.",
    "Edge leaks matter: exchanges, devices, and network metadata often defeat good on-chain practice."

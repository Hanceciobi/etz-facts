    "Why are bridge deposits and mints so easy to correlate across chains?",

    "What habits create the strongest linkability right after funds arrive?",
    "How can builders reduce exposure in event design, batching, and relayer operations?",
    "How can users limit cross-chain correlation while staying lawful and responsible?"

  "quickSteps": [
    "Avoid unique amounts and block-tight sequences (arrive → swap → withdraw). Add spacing when you can.",
    "Separate fee payers and roles across chains; don’t stitch steps together with the same account.",
    "Use fresh addresses per purpose, but remember exits to regulated services can still anchor identity.",
    "Prefer designs that minimize trusted logging surfaces (proof-based verification when feasible).",
    "Reduce edge metadata: safer connectivity, fewer screenshots, and no public tx context while in flight.",
    "Keep a private audit log (txids, times, addresses) for your own records—not for public sharing."

    "Proof-based verification reduces reliance on intermediaries, but timing/amount correlation usually remains.",
    "Batch cadence and synchronized logs can reveal depositor cohorts even when amounts collide.",
    "Fee-payer reuse is a common hidden link that stitches cross-chain steps together.",
    "RPC endpoints, telemetry, and public screenshots can leak metadata outside on-chain data.",
    "Aim for proportionate, lawful confidentiality—reduce unnecessary exposure without obstructing legitimate oversight."

    "What is ZenX and how is it different from a swap provider?",

    "How do I avoid ad traps and lookalike domains when searching for swap routes?",

    "Does this partnership make swaps invisible on-chain?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Verify the source: use bookmarks and confirm the full domain before you compare routes.",
    "Keep roles separate: use a small interaction wallet for swapping and store long-term funds elsewhere.",
    "Avoid broad permissions: don’t approve anything you can’t explain in one sentence.",
    "Stay deliberate: compare routes calmly, then execute the swap without rushing through prompts.",
    "Pause on doubt: if a page feels urgent or odd, close it and retry from a clean browser profile/device."

          "Open the real site from a bookmark or manually typed URL",
          "Re-check the route details (asset, chain, receive address) before proceeding",
          "Avoid any prompts asking for seed phrases or remote access"

        "then": [
          "Avoid panic-retries across multiple providers at once",
          "Document TXIDs, timestamps, and the route/provider you selected",
          "Wait for normal confirmations, then check status via an explorer",
          "Use only official support channels; ignore unsolicited DMs"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Many swap incidents start before the chain: ad traps, lookalike domains, and urgent fake prompts.",
    "A privacy-first comparison layer can reduce passive tracking, but it does not make on-chain activity invisible.",
    "Never share seed phrases, private keys, or accept remote-access requests from “support”.",
    "Using an interaction wallet limits blast radius if a swap session goes wrong."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "Why is Bitcoin dropping right now: sentiment, macro pressure, regulation, or crypto-specific events?",
    "Which indicators help distinguish a routine correction from a structural trend shift?",
    "How do regulation headlines and enforcement actions translate into BTC price moves?",
    "What liquidity signals matter during sharp declines (spread, depth, and forced selling)?",
    "What risk rules help you avoid panic decisions during volatility?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Identify the main driver: macro risk-off, policy headlines, or crypto-specific stress.",
    "Watch liquidity (spread and depth) and avoid large market orders during turbulence.",
    "Use staged entries/exits and define risk limits before you act.",
    "Reduce leverage when volatility expands; liquidation cascades are common in fast drops.",
    "Keep operational hygiene: verify links, double-check networks, and store backups offline."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Separate the catalyst (macro, regulation, or crypto-specific), then manage exposure first: size, leverage, and execution costs. Only after that should you plan entries or long-term accumulation.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "The move is mostly macro-driven (rates up, risk-off markets)",
        "then": [
          "Expect correlation with equities and weaker risk appetite.",
          "Prefer smaller size, patience, and staged accumulation near support zones."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The move is driven by regulation or policy headlines",
        "then": [
          "Assume headline whipsaws and fast reversals; avoid chasing candles.",
          "Wait for volatility to compress and volume to stabilize before scaling in."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The move is mostly sentiment and momentum selling",
        "then": [
          "Watch for capitulation signals: volume spikes, funding extremes, and long wicks.",
          "Use conservative tranches and keep liquidity for retries instead of one-shot timing."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Volatility clusters: sharp drops can be followed by sharp rebounds—plan for both.",
    "Liquidity thins during stress; spreads and slippage can dominate outcomes.",
    "News-driven moves are noisy; position sizing and risk rules matter more than predictions."

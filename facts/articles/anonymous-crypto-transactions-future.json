  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “anonymous” mean in crypto, and what does it not guarantee?",
    "Which privacy techniques matter most (rings, stealth addresses, confidential amounts, zk-proofs, CoinJoin)?",
    "Where do people lose privacy even when the protocol is strong (metadata, behavior, KYC edges)?",
    "How do wallets and network hygiene (Tor, nodes, telemetry) change real-world outcomes?",
    "How do regulation and the Travel Rule intersect with self-custody and private payments?",
    "Which technologies are most likely to shape the next decade of privacy-preserving transfers?"

  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide what you’re protecting: public profiling, business confidentiality, or everyday discretion.",
    "Start small and test the full flow (fund → transfer → receive → refund) before scaling.",
    "Avoid address reuse and avoid posting txids/timestamps publicly while funds are in motion.",
    "Use transport privacy (Tor where supported) and minimize telemetry and browser extensions.",
    "Keep private records for taxes/accounting without broadcasting your activity publicly.",
    "Treat your seed phrase like cash: offline backups, tested recovery, and clean devices."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Protocol privacy doesn’t automatically protect network metadata (IP, RPC endpoints, timing patterns).",
    "KYC on/off ramps and regulated service transfers can create durable identity anchors at the edges.",
    "Phishing and fake wallet updates are a bigger practical threat than cryptography failure for most users.",
    "Liquidity and UX friction are real: plan size, timing, and exit routes ahead of time.",
    "Use privacy as data minimization and personal safety—not as a substitute for lawful compliance."

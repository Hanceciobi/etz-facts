  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat transaction history as untrusted: never copy recipient addresses from “recent” or from past transfers.",
    "Use a verified address book/whitelist for your own wallets, exchanges, and recurring recipients.",
    "Verify the full destination address (not only the first/last characters) and do a second-check for large sends.",
    "Prefer QR codes when possible and separate wallets by role (storage vs spending vs experimentation).",
    "Ignore memo links and “claim” bait; if an address mismatch happens, stop and check for clipboard malware."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide your purpose: trading liquidity, payments, or a volatility hedge.",
    "Pick the right network for your transfer (fees, speed, exchange support).",
    "Send a small test transaction before moving larger amounts.",
    "Prefer self-custody for longer holding; avoid leaving balances on exchanges.",
    "Understand stablecoin risks: issuer controls, compliance pressure, and blacklists."

          "Treat USDT as a tool, not a risk-free bank account.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Issuer and compliance risk: stablecoin issuers can freeze addresses on some chains.",
    "Counterparty risk: exchanges and custodians can restrict withdrawals or suffer incidents.",
    "Network risk: sending on the wrong chain can delay recovery or make it impossible.",
    "Regulatory risk: rules can change access, listings, and reporting requirements."

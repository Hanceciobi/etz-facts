  "riskNotes": [
    "Sponsored search ads and DM links are common entry points for cloned wallet download pages.",

    "Remote-support scams often succeed because the victim is rushed and distracted.",
    "Cloud sync of screenshots and notes can leak recovery words and backups.",
    "If you cannot guarantee a clean environment, rushing a recovery transfer can increase losses."

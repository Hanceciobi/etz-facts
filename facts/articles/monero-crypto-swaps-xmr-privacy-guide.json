  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a crypto swap, and how is it different from selling to fiat and buying back?",
    "Which swap models exist (non-custodial services, DEX routes, routers, atomic swaps)?",
    "How does Monero hide sender, receiver, and amount by default?",
    "How do confirmations, timers, and rate types affect execution for XMR swaps?",
    "What really determines your outcome: fees, spread, slippage, limits, and congestion?",
    "What habits reduce metadata leaks and linkability across the non-XMR leg?",
    "How do you troubleshoot a swap that looks stuck or expired?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Choose fixed vs floating based on your ability to fund quickly and network congestion.",
    "Verify the exact asset + chain on both legs (especially stablecoins).",
    "Use fresh payout addresses and separate contexts (spending vs savings).",
    "Plan for confirmation thresholds; the slowest leg sets the total time.",
    "Save minimal proof privately (quote ID, txids, timestamps) for support.",
    "Treat privacy as routine: reduce edge metadata (IP, screenshots, chats)."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "My XMR swap feels confusing or risky — what should I do first?",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You need price certainty and can send promptly.",
        "then": [
          "Use a fixed-rate quote and fund immediately.",
          "Pick miner fees that confirm within the quote window.",
          "Save the quote ID and timer details before you send."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Networks are congested or you can’t race a timer.",
        "then": [
          "Use a floating-rate quote to avoid strict deadlines.",
          "Expect minor slippage in volatile windows.",
          "Budget extra time for confirmations on both legs."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re worried about privacy leaks outside the XMR leg.",
        "then": [
          "Use fresh payout addresses and avoid address reuse.",
          "Separate activities across wallets/subaddresses.",
          "Avoid posting tx links, screenshots, or exact patterns publicly."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The swap looks stuck or expired.",
        "then": [
          "Check the funding transaction status and confirmation count.",
          "Compare against the service’s required confirmation threshold.",
          "If a timer expired, review the re-quote/refund policy and keep proof."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "The non-XMR leg can leak metadata even when XMR on-chain data is private.",
    "Fixed-rate swaps are sensitive to delays; low fees can void the rate window.",
    "Wrong network or missing memo/tag is a common cause of loss and manual recovery.",
    "Thin liquidity increases spreads and slippage for larger swaps.",
    "Refunds and repeated patterns can create linkable traces if you reuse addresses."

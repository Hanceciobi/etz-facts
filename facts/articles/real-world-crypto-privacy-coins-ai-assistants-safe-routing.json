    "Define your threat model and goals so you know whether you are mainly defending against chain analysis, centralized logs, legal pressure, or a mix of all three.",
    "Classify your assets and routes into public and private rails, and decide where Monero, Zano, and Zcash belong in that structure alongside more transparent coins.",
    "Set clear boundaries for AI assistants by refusing to paste seeds, keys, full address maps, or detailed route histories, and by preferring tools with controllable logging and training.",
    "Build a network and exchange stack that matches your model by choosing when to use VPNs or Tor, which no-KYC services to trust, and which browsers and devices handle KYC versus private activity.",
    "Review and adjust your habits regularly, updating wallets, routes, and AI settings so your privacy practices stay aligned with your goals and the evolving regulatory and technical landscape."

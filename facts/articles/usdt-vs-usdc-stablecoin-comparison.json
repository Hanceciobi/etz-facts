    "What is the real difference between USDT and USDC?",

    "What are the practical risks: depegs, freezes, or compliance controls?",
    "How do you choose the right network to reduce fees and mistakes?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide what you need most: liquidity, transparency, or compliance fit.",
    "Choose the chain (fees/speed) and verify you’re on the correct network.",
    "Confirm the token contract if you’re using DeFi or a wallet swap.",
    "Start with a small test transfer when using a new address or chain.",
    "Keep basic records (TXIDs, screenshots) for accounting and troubleshooting."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Pick USDT or USDC based on the main constraint: liquidity/availability vs reporting/compliance, then choose the lowest-fee chain you can safely use.",

        "then": [
          "Prefer USDT on the venue/chain with the best liquidity for your pair.",

        "then": [

  "riskNotes": [
    "Stablecoins can deviate from $1 during stress; don’t assume perfect peg in all conditions.",
    "Issuer-level controls (freezes/blacklists) exist for some stablecoins and may affect funds in edge cases.",
    "Most user losses come from operational errors: wrong network, wrong address, or unverified token contracts."

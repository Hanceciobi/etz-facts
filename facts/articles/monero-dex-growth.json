  "quickSteps": [
    "Understand the trade-off: privacy vs. the restrictions of regulated centralized venues.",
    "Choose a non-custodial swap route when you want self-custody and fewer account barriers.",
    "Verify coin/network details and confirm amounts before sending funds.",
    "Start with a small test swap if you’re using a new venue or route.",
    "Use basic hygiene: clean device, verified links, and secure wallet backups."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Regulatory pressure can change access to privacy coins on centralized venues quickly.",
    "Counterparty and custody risk exist on centralized exchanges, even with strong brands.",
    "Execution risk: thin liquidity or network congestion can affect swap timing and price.",
    "Phishing risk: fake “DEX links” and impersonated support are common—verify URLs."

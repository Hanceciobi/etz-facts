  "keyQuestions": [
    "Why does an environmental data network need a token at all?",
    "How can AIOT align devices, validators, and real customers over time?",

    "How does decentralized validation improve data integrity and pricing?",
    "Which roadmap milestones best separate traction from narrative?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat tokenomics as flows: emissions, paid demand, validation costs, and governance feedback loops.",
    "Check data integrity design: redundancy, reputation, staking/slashing, and anomaly detection.",
    "Look for repeat buyers (APIs/SLAs), not just dashboards and incentive spikes.",
    "If cross-chain is planned, verify canonical supply and emergency runbooks; bridges add risk.",
    "Track real signals: audits, active coverage, paying pilots, and transparent governance iteration."

          "Look for published customer pilots, SLAs, and pricing tiers for data access",
          "Check whether emissions trend down as paid demand replaces subsidies",

          "Confirm whether bridging is wrapped or dual-deploy and how total supply is coordinated",
          "Assess bridge trust assumptions and audited code paths",

  "riskNotes": [
    "DePIN token networks can overpay early; sustainability requires paid demand that replaces subsidies over time.",
    "Environmental telemetry is easy to game; validation and reputation must be designed before scaling volume.",
    "Cross-chain expansion increases attack surface; bridges and canonical supply require simple, auditable runbooks.",
    "Privacy matters: coverage and analytics must avoid turning measurement into unwanted surveillance."

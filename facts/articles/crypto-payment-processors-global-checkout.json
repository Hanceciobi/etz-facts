    "What does a crypto payment processor do between checkout and the blockchain?",

    "How can a business handle volatility without holding coins?",
    "How should merchants pilot and compare processors before choosing one?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Shortlist 2–3 processors based on fees, settlement options, and integration fit (plugin vs API).",
    "Pilot on staging with sandbox/webhooks and verify reconciliation in your accounting flow.",
    "Compare effective cost per order (fees + spread), time-to-cash, and support responsiveness.",
    "Define refund and late/under/overpayment handling before scaling traffic.",
    "Optionally add a privacy route for buyers while settling in fiat/stablecoins on your side."

          "Choose a processor with a strong API, signed webhooks, retries, and sandbox support",
          "Prototype an invoice flow and confirm accounting exports match your needs",

  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Headline rates can hide spread and conversion costs—measure effective cost per order during a pilot.",
    "Security posture matters: insist on 2FA, role-based access, signed webhooks, and clear key management practices.",
    "Refund and dispute processes differ from cards; define policy and edge-case runbooks early.",
    "Privacy-friendly buyer routes can exist alongside clean merchant reconciliation—keep documentation consistent."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with your goal (speed, privacy, supported coins, minimums) before you compare routes.",
    "Use a comparison page as a shortlist, then verify the final domain letter-for-letter before you proceed.",
    "Prefer routes that are clear about flow (what you send, what you receive, timing, and fees).",
    "Test with a small amount when you change a provider, network, or payout wallet.",
    "Save basic order info for yourself (time, amount, destination) and ignore DMs offering “help” or “recovery.”"

          "Assume quotes can change quickly; verify what you’ll receive before you deposit",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Directory listings can be outdated; always verify the live domain and conditions before you deposit.",
    "Lookalike domains and sponsored links are a frequent source of swap-related losses.",
    "A “too good” rate is often a signal to slow down and verify, not a reason to rush.",
    "Changing network/chain assumptions mid-swap is a common mistake; confirm chain details before you send."

    "My crypto transaction is stuck — what should I do first?",
    "How can I tell normal network congestion from a scam?",
    "Should I pay for a transaction accelerator or fee boost?",
    "What information is safe to share when asking for help?",
    "What actually works: RBF, speed-up, cancel — and when?",
    "What should I do if someone asks for a recovery fee or remote access?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Verify the real status in a reputable block explorer: confirmed, pending/unconfirmed, or not found.",
    "Identify the chain rules: Bitcoin-like fee competition vs Ethereum-like nonce/gas vs networks where waiting is the only safe option.",
    "Use only built-in wallet controls (RBF, Speed up, Cancel) — never third-party “accelerators” promoted via ads or DMs.",
    "Ignore unsolicited “support” and refuse access requests: no seed phrase, no private keys, no keystore files, no screen sharing, no remote tools.",
    "After confirmation, close the loop: verify balances, record the TXID/timestamps, and avoid “test transfers” that add confusion."

          "Confirm you copied the correct TXID and selected the correct chain/explorer",
          "Check whether your wallet broadcasted the transaction (some apps queue before broadcasting)",

      },
      {
        "if": "The TX is pending/unconfirmed in the explorer",
        "then": [
          "Compare your fee/gas to current network conditions to understand whether congestion is likely",
          "If your wallet offers RBF/Speed up/Cancel, use only those built-in actions",
          "If no safe replacement exists, wait and monitor confirmations — don’t send extra “test” transactions"

      },
      {
        "if": "Someone contacts you first offering a fee boost, accelerator, or recovery service",
        "then": [
          "Treat it as a scam attempt and do not click links or pay fees",
          "Never share seed phrases, private keys, or grant remote access/screen sharing",
          "Use only official support channels you already trust"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Scammers exploit urgency: fake accelerators, fee boosts, and impersonated support are most active when a transaction is pending.",
    "Wallet UIs can lag or misreport; treat a reputable block explorer as the source of truth for status and confirmations.",
    "Third-party “recovery fees” don’t upgrade your on-chain transaction — they usually just transfer money to scammers.",
    "Remote access and screen sharing can be enough to drain funds even without a seed phrase; refuse it every time."

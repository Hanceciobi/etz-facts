  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a Bitcoin-backed loan, and how does it differ from selling BTC?",
    "How do LTV ratios work, and what triggers margin calls or liquidation?",
    "What costs matter most (interest, fees, spreads, and repayment terms)?",
    "What custody and counterparty risks should borrowers understand upfront?",
    "What practical checklist reduces liquidation and operational mistakes?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Pick a conservative LTV and assume BTC can drop quickly during volatility.",
    "Read the platform’s liquidation thresholds, fees, and interest model before depositing BTC.",
    "Keep extra collateral available and set alerts for LTV and price moves.",
    "Prefer staged borrowing and repay early if risk increases or terms become unfavorable.",
    "Plan custody: verify addresses, use strong account security, and keep backups offline."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your objective (short-term liquidity vs long-term financing), then choose an LTV that survives drawdowns. Treat liquidation rules and custody as first-class risks, not footnotes.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You want maximum safety against liquidation",
        "then": [
          "Use a lower LTV than the maximum offered and keep a collateral buffer.",
          "Set alerts and add collateral early instead of waiting for margin calls."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You need more borrowing power",
        "then": [
          "Increase LTV carefully and split borrowing into tranches to manage timing risk.",
          "Accept that higher LTV can force liquidation during fast drops."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re concerned about custody and platform failure risk",
        "then": [
          "Research track record, transparency, and custody practices before depositing BTC.",
          "Avoid concentrating large collateral with one provider; diversify when size is meaningful."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "BTC volatility is the dominant risk: liquidation can happen quickly during sharp moves.",
    "Custody and counterparty risk exist whenever a platform holds your collateral.",
    "Fees and terms vary; small differences can matter a lot over time, especially with variable rates."

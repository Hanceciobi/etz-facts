  "keyQuestions": [
    "Why do people move value from ETH into XMR in the first place?",
    "What privacy and fungibility problems does Monero solve that ETH cannot by default?",
    "Which security surfaces matter most during an ETH→XMR move (device, network, counterparty, records)?",
    "What are the most common operational mistakes that leak metadata or invite scams?",
    "How can you keep lawful records without turning your transactions into public content?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Use a non-custodial route where you control the destination wallet and avoid mid-flow identity requests.",
    "Verify the domain and deposit details every time; treat impossible quotes as a red flag.",
    "Receive XMR to a fresh wallet destination and avoid address reuse or public sharing.",
    "Protect the edges: updated devices, cautious browser hygiene, and VPN on untrusted networks.",
    "Keep minimal private receipts (order ID, hashes, timestamps) for compliance and disputes."

        "if": "My goal is business confidentiality (vendors, payroll, donors)",
        "then": [
          "Use default-private settlement for sensitive payments",
          "Keep accounting records privately and avoid sharing addresses publicly",
          "Compartmentalize wallets by purpose (operating vs savings)"

      {
        "if": "My biggest risk is scams, impersonation, and custody creep",
        "then": [
          "Bookmark the correct domain and verify it before every swap",
          "Never share seed phrases; never install ‘support’ software",
          "Exit if extra deposits or personal data are requested mid-flow"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "My biggest risk is metadata leakage (IP, timing, screenshots)",
        "then": [
          "Use VPN/Tor where appropriate and reduce browser fingerprinting",
          "Avoid screenshots and chat logs that include addresses or personal identifiers",
          "Separate public DeFi activity from private settlement wallets"

      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "ETH is transparent by design; privacy on transparent rails is brittle and easy to undo with one mistake.",
    "Monero reduces on-chain leakage, but edge metadata (devices, network, behavior) still matters.",
    "Fees and venue availability differ; plan buffers for confirmation times and payout delays.",
    "Privacy does not remove tax/compliance duties—keep private records for lawful reporting."

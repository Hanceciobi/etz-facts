    "What is SimpleX, and how is it different from typical messaging platforms?",

    "What practical benefits should organizations expect after implementing SimpleX?",
    "What are the safest steps to roll out a new communication stack without disrupting operations?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Define your communication goals (security, speed, integration, or compliance).",
    "Pilot SimpleX with a small team and capture friction points early.",
    "Set clear onboarding docs and training so adoption doesn’t stall.",
    "Integrate with existing tools where needed (workflows, repos, incident response).",
    "Monitor performance and security, then scale gradually with feedback loops."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your main constraint (security, latency, or tooling). Choose a pilot scope, validate reliability and onboarding, then expand to wider teams once workflows stabilize.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Your main concern is data privacy and compliance",
        "then": [
          "Map what data must be protected and where it currently leaks via tooling.",
          "Prioritize end-to-end encryption, minimal metadata exposure, and controlled access."

        "if": "Your teams need fast real-time coordination",
        "then": [
          "Test latency and reliability under realistic load and distributed locations.",

      {
        "if": "You need smooth integration with existing systems",
        "then": [
          "List critical integrations (CI/CD, ticketing, storage) and validate each during the pilot.",

  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Tooling transitions can fail due to poor onboarding; plan training and a phased rollout.",
    "Protocol benefits still require good operational discipline: access control, device hygiene, and clear workflows.",
    "Measure success with concrete metrics (response time, incident coordination, and adoption), not just feature lists."

    "What makes an altcoin a viable long-term hold beyond hype?",
    "How do you evaluate fundamentals: utility, security, token economics, and governance?",
    "Which metrics signal real adoption instead of short-lived speculation?",
    "How should you diversify across categories (L1s, interoperability, oracles, ecosystems)?",
    "What custody and operational hygiene reduces long-term risk?",
    "When should you trim or exit a long-term position?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Define your thesis: utility, adoption, and defensible differentiation—not narratives.",
    "Pick a basket across categories (base layers + interoperability + data/oracles).",
    "Favor projects with shipping cadence, audits, and a transparent roadmap.",
    "Size positions based on liquidity and downside tolerance; avoid leverage.",
    "Secure custody (hardware wallet for meaningful balances) and review approvals routinely.",
    "Re-evaluate quarterly and exit if the thesis breaks (security, governance, stalled shipping)."

          "Trim when position size grows beyond your risk budget.",
          "Exit when assumptions break or better risk-adjusted opportunities appear."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Smaller caps offer more upside but come with higher execution and liquidity risk.",
    "Strong narratives can mask weak token economics or fragile governance.",
    "Custody mistakes and approval drains can dominate long-term outcomes more than price moves.",
    "Regulatory changes can alter exchange access and on/off-ramp friction by jurisdiction.",
    "Diversification helps, but only if the assets are truly different in drivers and risk."

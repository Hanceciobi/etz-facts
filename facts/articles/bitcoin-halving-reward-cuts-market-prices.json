  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a Bitcoin halving, and why does it happen every 210,000 blocks?",
    "How does a reward cut change daily BTC issuance and miner sell pressure?",
    "Why doesn’t price necessarily react immediately on halving day?",
    "What metrics help you track miner stress, liquidity, and demand around the event?",
    "How can you plan and manage risk during the halving window?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Understand the schedule and the size of the issuance change (before you form expectations).",
    "Watch miner health indicators: hash rate trends, difficulty, and known treasury flows.",
    "Track liquidity and positioning: spreads, depth, funding, and options skew.",
    "Use staged entries and predefined risk limits; avoid over-leverage into volatility spikes.",
    "Secure custody before activity picks up: backups, device hygiene, and small test transfers."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Start with your objective (long-horizon accumulation vs tactical positioning). Then set risk limits, choose an execution plan, and monitor miner and liquidity signals for context.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You are accumulating for the long run",
        "then": [
          "Use a steady schedule (DCA) and avoid treating the halving date as a single binary bet.",
          "Rebalance periodically so a single asset doesn’t dominate portfolio risk."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You are trading the halving window",
        "then": [
          "Expect volatility and whipsaws; use defined risk per trade and avoid emotional scaling.",
          "Prefer limit orders and staged execution to reduce slippage in thin moments."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Miner stress appears to be rising (profitability shock)",
        "then": [
          "Monitor hash rate dips and difficulty adjustments as the system rebalances.",
          "Avoid assuming miner capitulation always equals a bottom; confirm with liquidity and demand signals."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Halvings reduce new supply, but price is still set by demand, liquidity, and broader macro conditions.",
    "The marginal impact shrinks in absolute BTC terms each cycle; markets may price expectations earlier.",
    "Execution risk is real: thin books, leverage cascades, and headline-driven volatility can punish poor sizing."

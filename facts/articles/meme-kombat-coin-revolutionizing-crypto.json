  "keyQuestions": [
    "What problem does Meme Kombat Coin (MKC) solve beyond typical meme-coin hype?",
    "How do the battle arena and staking features create ongoing token utility?",
    "Which signals matter most for adoption in GameFi-style projects (users, volume, retention)?",
    "What tokenomics mechanisms (burns, caps, incentives) affect long-term supply and demand?",
    "What practical safety checklist reduces mistakes when exploring new gaming tokens?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with the basics: verify the correct token details and network before doing anything.",
    "Evaluate utility: how battles, staking, and governance actually drive demand for MKC.",
    "Check liquidity and spreads; avoid large market orders during hype spikes.",
    "Use a small test transfer first, then scale up in tranches if needed.",
    "Keep custody and device hygiene tight: verified links, separate wallets, offline backups."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Decide whether you’re evaluating MKC as a GameFi product, a market trade, or both. Confirm token details, then look at real usage (activity, staking participation, tournaments) alongside liquidity and execution conditions.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You’re mainly here for gameplay and tournaments",
        "then": [
          "Focus on participation incentives, fairness, and how rewards are funded.",
          "Start with small stakes until you understand mechanics and timing."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re mainly here as an investor/trader",
        "then": [
          "Treat it as high-volatility: size positions conservatively and avoid leverage.",
          "Use staged entries/exits and watch spreads and depth, not only price."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Liquidity looks thin or hype is peaking",
        "then": [
          "Reduce clip size and prefer limit orders to control slippage.",
          "Be ready for sudden drawdowns once viral momentum cools."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Most meme/GameFi assets are sentiment-driven and can swing sharply; liquidity can disappear during stress.",
    "Utility helps, but adoption and retention are what sustain demand after hype fades.",
    "Operational mistakes (wrong token/network, unsafe links, poor wallet hygiene) remain the most common avoidable loss."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Freeze: don’t send a second “test” transfer while you’re unsure.",
    "Use the TXID in an explorer to confirm the chain, destination, and token contract (if applicable).",
    "Decide custody: your wallet (you control keys) vs platform deposit vs unknown address.",
    "If it’s your wallet: switch network view, import the token if needed, get native gas, then move funds carefully.",
    "If it’s a platform: open a precise support ticket and ignore DMs, “recovery agents,” seed-phrase requests, and remote-access offers."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Same ticker name can represent different token contracts across chains.",
    "Many EVM networks share 0x addresses; address format alone doesn’t prove the correct chain.",
    "Missing memo/tag can prevent auto-crediting on custodial deposits; wrong memo can be worse than none.",
    "Scammers target panic windows with fake support, recovery links, and seed-phrase phishing."

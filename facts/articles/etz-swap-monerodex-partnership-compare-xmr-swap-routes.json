  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is MoneroDEX and what does it actually do when comparing swap routes?",
    "Does MoneroDEX custody funds or require deposits before you choose a provider?",
    "Why would a user pick ETZ Swap from the offers list — what’s the practical difference?",
    "What should you compare: provider rate, provider fee, network fees, or execution time?",
    "What information is safe to share with support if something feels off during a swap?",
    "How do you reduce wrong-network / wrong-address mistakes in a compare → choose → execute flow?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Compare offers calmly: pick based on your real constraint (speed, simplicity, terms), not only the headline rate.",
    "Verify the basics twice: asset, network, deposit address, and destination address.",
    "Execute from a clean environment: avoid rushing on a compromised or overloaded device.",
    "If support is needed, share only public data: TXID, time sent, amount, and asset/network used.",
    "Keep control boundaries strict: never share recovery secrets and never accept “remote help.”"
  ],
  "riskNotes": [
    "Aggregators reduce tab-hopping, but look‑alike domains and fake “route” pages still exist — verify URLs letter‑for‑letter.",
    "A slightly better quote can be offset by network fees or a slower route; compare time and conditions, not just price.",
    "Multi‑network assets make mistakes easy; the TXID’s chain must match the chain you intended to use.",
    "Scammers target urgency windows with fake support and “instant fixes”; share only public info and never seeds/keys."

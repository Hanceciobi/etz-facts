  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “crypto tracing” actually mean—and what does it not prove?",
    "How do UTXO and account-based chains change tracing workflows and evidence?",
    "Which heuristics are most common (clustering, change detection), and where do they fail?",
    "How do analysts handle DeFi routers, L2s/rollups, and cross-chain bridges?",
    "What are the biggest limits and blind spots (mixing, privacy coins, shared addresses)?",
    "What legal and ethical guardrails should beginners follow when tracing funds?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start from one tx hash and verify chain + network before drawing conclusions.",
    "Decode the transaction (inputs/outputs or from/to + logs) and capture evidence links.",
    "Expand one hop at a time and label known services (exchanges, routers, bridges).",
    "Look for patterns (peeling, fan-outs, consolidation) and state confidence levels.",
    "Document choke points where intervention is realistic (KYC off-ramps, bridges).",
    "Keep your work ethical: purpose-limited, minimal data, no doxxing, audit-ready notes."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I want to trace a transaction responsibly — how do I begin without jumping to conclusions?",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You only have a single tx hash and no context.",
        "then": [
          "Open it in a block explorer and confirm network, time, and direction of value.",
          "Record the addresses, amounts, fees, and any contract events.",
          "Expand to the immediate neighbors only (one hop) and label any known entities."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "The flow hits DeFi or smart contracts (routers, bridges, mixers).",
        "then": [
          "Read event logs to reconstruct token movement; don’t assume the ‘to’ address is the beneficiary.",
          "Treat the contract as infrastructure; focus on the origin and ultimate destination.",
          "Document the exact contract addresses and timestamps to support replay."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re trying to connect to a person rather than a service.",
        "then": [
          "Be explicit: on-chain data often leads to a service, not an individual.",
          "Require off-chain evidence (legal requests, disclosures) before attribution to a person.",
          "Write findings as hypotheses with confidence, not as facts."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re doing incident response or risk screening.",
        "then": [
          "Identify potential choke points (exchanges/off-ramps) with precise deposit addresses and times.",
          "Preserve evidence (screenshots, URLs, block heights) for escalation.",
          "Stop when commingling makes certainty drop; focus on actionable touchpoints."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Heuristics are probabilistic and can be broken by CoinJoin, shared custody, and deliberate obfuscation.",
    "Cross-chain and L2 flows desynchronize time/amount signals; matching often needs multiple cues.",
    "Privacy coins and shielded pools reduce public traceability; edges (entry/exit) become the focus.",
    "Over-sharing addresses and findings can harm innocents; avoid doxxing and keep data minimal.",
    "Good tracing is repeatable: record every assumption, source URL, and uncertainty."

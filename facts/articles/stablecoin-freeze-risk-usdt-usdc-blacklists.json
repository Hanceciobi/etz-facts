  "keyQuestions": [
    "Can stablecoins be frozen, and what do blacklists mean for USDT/USDC users?",
    "Can USDT or USDC be frozen after I receive it in my wallet?",
    "What does “blocklisted” mean on-chain, and why can balances still display normally?",
    "Can stablecoins be frozen on one chain but not another — and what changes with bridged versions?",
    "How can I reduce blacklist risk without oversharing my identity graph?",
    "Should I avoid receiving stablecoins from unknown sources, and what are the red flags?",
    "What should I do first if my stablecoin transfer fails or an exchange says “restricted funds”?",
    "How do I keep stablecoin routing hygiene clean for swaps and payouts?",
    "When is “freeze risk” real, and when is it exaggerated?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Confirm whether the issue is on-chain or just a wallet/platform limitation by checking the network, gas, and the explorer failure reason.",
    "Stop mixing immediately: keep the suspected stablecoins separate from your main balances and avoid routing them through multiple apps.",
    "Try a tiny test transfer to an address you control to confirm whether transfers are actually restricted.",
    "Collect minimal proof only (txids, timestamps, chain, context) and use official issuer or platform support channels if escalation is needed.",
    "For future flows, accept unknown-source stablecoins into a separate receiving address, verify movement first, then swap or distribute."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Many centralized stablecoins can enforce on-chain transfer restrictions; a visible balance does not guarantee spendability.",
    "The same ticker on different chains can represent different contracts; bridged versions add extra control points and risks.",

    "Containment matters: stop mixing and stop routing suspected funds through multiple apps to avoid spreading the problem.",
    "Never accept ‘support’ via DMs, remote access, or paid unfreeze promises; use official channels only and share minimal proof."

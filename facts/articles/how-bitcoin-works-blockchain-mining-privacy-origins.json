  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a blockchain, and why does it make Bitcoin hard to rewrite?",
    "How does Proof-of-Work mining secure Bitcoin, and what are the trade-offs?",
    "Is Bitcoin anonymous, and what does “pseudonymous” mean in practice?",
    "Why does Bitcoin have a fixed supply of 21 million coins?",
    "What are realistic everyday use cases for Bitcoin beyond speculation?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Learn the base model: a public ledger (blockchain) secured by cryptography and incentives.",
    "Understand mining/PoW: how blocks are produced and why it resists tampering.",
    "Treat privacy correctly: Bitcoin is transparent; privacy comes from good habits, not secrecy by default.",
    "Use safe basics: verify addresses, keep backups, and prefer self-custody for long-term holdings.",
    "Start small: test transactions first before moving larger amounts."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "If you’re new to Bitcoin, decide first whether your goal is learning, payments, or long-term holding, then set up the simplest workflow that matches it.",

        "if": "You want to hold BTC for the long term",
        "then": [
          "Use a wallet you control and back up recovery information safely.",
          "Enable strong device security and avoid keeping large balances on exchanges.",
          "Consider a hardware wallet if the amount is meaningful to you."

      },
      {
        "if": "You want to use BTC for transfers or payments",
        "then": [
          "Check network fees and confirmation expectations before sending.",
          "Use a small test payment first when sending to a new address.",
          "Avoid sharing addresses publicly if you care about privacy."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Custody risk: losing keys or using insecure storage can be irreversible.",
    "Fee and congestion risk: confirmation times and fees can vary during busy periods.",
    "Privacy risk: on-chain activity is public and can be analyzed if you reuse addresses.",
    "Market risk: volatility is normal; manage position size and time horizon accordingly."

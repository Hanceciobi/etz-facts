  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is “NFT 2.0” in plain terms, beyond collectibles and profile pictures?",
    "Which real utilities are emerging first: access passes, licensing, royalties, or interoperability?",
    "How do programmable NFTs manage rights, revenue splits, and time‑based access?",
    "Where do NFT 2.0 models already work today: games, events, media, education, or phygital goods?",
    "What are the main risks (fakes, bots, UX friction), and what mitigations actually help users?",
    "How do teams measure real utility beyond floor price and trading volume?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat NFTs as programmable access keys: define rights, time windows, and perks before you mint.",
    "Prefer simple UX: clear eligibility rules, stable pricing for perks, and support that resolves issues fast.",
    "Build utility first (access, licensing, royalties, interoperability) and let speculation stay secondary.",
    "Protect users: verified contract lists, anti‑fake guides, bot/friction controls, and transparent history.",
    "Track adoption metrics that reflect value: drop‑off points, utility usage, distribution concentration, and engagement."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I’m trying to evaluate (or build) NFT utility that lasts beyond hype",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Your NFT concept is mostly a picture with no lasting benefit",
        "then": [
          "Add concrete utility: access, discounts, licensing rights, or revenue participation",
          "Write rights in plain language and mirror them in smart‑contract logic",
          "Plan what happens after the event/season so the token still has purpose"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Users struggle with onboarding, wallets, gas fees, or confusing flows",
        "then": [
          "Make entry feel familiar (email/card where possible) and introduce wallets step‑by‑step",
          "Bundle or abstract gas so payment doesn’t fail at the last click",
          "Provide a verified contract list and a simple authenticity checklist"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Fakes, bots, and spam threaten credibility",
        "then": [
          "Publish a single verified contract list and teach users how to validate it",
          "Add rate limits and quest gates before mass operations",
          "Use visible creator verification and make audits easy to find"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Utility must lead speculation: if it doesn’t improve someone’s day, hype fades fast.",
    "Interoperability promises need partner alignment; avoid “works everywhere” claims without integration.",
    "UX friction (wallet setup, gas surprises) is the fastest way to lose newcomers.",
    "Fakes and bot spam scale with attention—verified contracts and user-verifiable guides are non‑negotiable."

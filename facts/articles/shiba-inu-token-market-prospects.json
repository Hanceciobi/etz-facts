  "keyQuestions": [
    "What makes SHIB different from other meme tokens besides branding and community hype?",
    "How does ShibaSwap add utility, and what risks come with DeFi features?",
    "What drives SHIB volatility: supply, liquidity, sentiment, or broader market cycles?",
    "What would need to happen for SHIB to perform well through 2025?",
    "How can you manage risk if you want SHIB exposure without overcommitting?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Treat SHIB as a high-volatility asset and size positions accordingly.",
    "Use reputable wallets and verify token contracts and links before interacting with DeFi.",
    "Avoid all-in entries—use staged buys and a clear exit plan.",
    "Track ecosystem updates (ShibaSwap, L2/utility plans) but separate news from price noise.",
    "Keep a diversified portfolio and limit meme-token exposure to what you can afford to lose."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Decide whether you’re trading volatility or holding for ecosystem growth. Then set strict position sizing and a plan for exits, because SHIB’s moves are often sentiment-driven.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You want long-term exposure to the SHIB ecosystem",
        "then": [
          "Focus on development progress and sustained user activity, not daily price swings.",
          "Use self-custody and keep speculative allocations small relative to core holdings."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re trading SHIB short-term",
        "then": [
          "Expect sharp reversals; use tight risk controls and avoid chasing pumps.",
          "Prioritize liquidity and execution—slippage can erase edge in fast markets."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re new to meme tokens",
        "then": [
          "Start with a small test position and learn how cycles and narratives impact price.",
          "Beware of impostor tokens and phishing—verify everything before you connect a wallet."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "SHIB is highly sentiment-driven; narratives can change quickly and unpredictably.",
    "DeFi interactions add smart-contract and phishing risk—use verified sources only.",
    "Large supply and retail-heavy flows can amplify volatility, especially during market stress."

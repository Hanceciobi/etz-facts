  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is a crypto swap to XMR, and how is it different from opening an exchange account?",
    "When does swapping into Monero make practical sense in real life?",
    "What is the end-to-end flow (quote → send → route → receive) and where do delays happen?",
    "How do fixed vs floating quotes change execution risk and timing?",
    "What costs matter most (network fees, spread, slippage), and how do you compare providers?",
    "Which operational habits reduce metadata leaks and prevent common mistakes?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Pick the pair and read the quote rules (rate type, timer, confirmations, refund policy).",
    "Send the exact amount to the deposit address before the timer ends (fixed-rate).",
    "Use a fresh XMR address/subaddress for each purpose to reduce accidental linkage.",
    "Compare outcomes by net XMR received, not marketing fees or headline rates.",
    "Keep a private log (quote ID, tx hashes, timestamps) for support and reconciliation.",
    "Reduce edge metadata: clean device, careful notes, and safer connectivity when needed."

        "then": [
          "Use a fixed-rate quote and fund immediately.",
          "Pick source-chain fees that confirm inside the quote window.",
          "Save the quote ID and timer details before sending."

      {
        "if": "You want more flexibility or network conditions are unstable.",
        "then": [
          "Use a floating-rate quote to avoid strict deadlines.",
          "Expect small drift during volatility windows.",
          "Budget extra time for confirmations on both legs."

      {
        "if": "You’re choosing a provider and want quick due diligence.",
        "then": [
          "Prefer non-custodial, accountless models when possible.",
          "Look for clear refund/expiration/slippage policies in plain language.",
          "Compare net outputs across multiple quotes before committing."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Something looks stuck or the quote expired.",
        "then": [
          "Check the funding tx status and required confirmation count.",
          "Compare against the provider’s stated threshold and window.",
          "Use official support channels only and never share your seed phrase."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "The source-chain transfer is visible; privacy depends on how you manage the edges and habits.",
    "Fixed-rate swaps can fail if confirmations arrive late; low fees can break the timer.",
    "Bigger swaps can face higher slippage; split into tranches when liquidity is thin.",
    "Address reuse and oversharing screenshots/tx links can create long-lived linkability.",
    "Keep proof privately for yourself; avoid building public dossiers of your activity."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Map how you are currently getting paid: which clients already use crypto, which assets they send and where your weak points are (single exposed wallet, risky exchange or nervous bank).",
    "Give your wallets clear roles by separating freelance income, long-term reserves and everyday personal spending so that no single address reveals your entire financial life.",
    "Decide what portion of your cash flow can stay public in stablecoins for clean invoices, and what portion you want to move into a privacy-focused asset like XMR as a quiet buffer.",
    "Plan a simple conversion schedule from crypto into fiat that aligns with rent, tax and recurring expenses, using a small set of trusted off-ramps and fewer, well-documented cash-outs.",
    "Write a short, consistent explanation of your crypto workflow that you would be comfortable sharing with a bank or accountant, and keep invoices plus key transaction proofs organized in advance."

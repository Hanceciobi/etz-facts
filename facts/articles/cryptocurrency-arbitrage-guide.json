  "quickSteps": [
    "Pick exchanges/venues with enough liquidity and predictable fees.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Execution risk: gaps close fast, and delays can turn a trade negative.",
    "Fee and slippage risk: many “profitable” spreads vanish after costs.",
    "Custody and counterparty risk: exchange outages and freezes can trap funds.",
    "Operational risk: mis-sent assets or wrong networks can be difficult to recover."

    "Treat your seed phrase as a master key: if an invisible copy can exist, it can be stolen without you noticing.",
    "Default to offline storage: write it down (or use metal) and keep two backups in two separate secure locations.",
    "Avoid “silent-copy” traps: no screenshots/photos, no cloud notes/Drive folders, no chats, no email drafts, no searchable files.",
    "If you must use a password manager for a small ‘spending’ wallet, harden it with strong unique credentials, phishing-proof 2FA, and strict device/profile separation.",
    "If exposure is even possible: stop using the old wallet, create a new seed on a clean device, move funds methodically, and fix the leak that caused it."

    "What does tokenization mean in UK markets when law remains the source of truth?",
    "Which assets are realistically tokenized today (funds, SPVs, credit, shares, alternatives)?",

    "What creates real secondary liquidity versus “liquidity theater” in tokenized markets?",
    "What are the main frictions and risks for UK managers and investors adopting tokenization?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with a wrapper that needs minimal legal lift and clear investor protections.",
    "Automate KYC → mint and NAV → issue with clean operational checkpoints.",
    "Encode eligibility and transfer rules in contracts, backed by compliant custodial workflows.",
    "Choose venues that support predictable, permissioned secondary liquidity and lifecycle events.",
    "Track outcomes: retention, real turnover, settlement SLAs, and operational break reduction."

          "Focus on rights, custody, and venue rules—not just chain choice",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Tokenization reduces reconciliation and settlement friction, but it introduces new key-management and smart contract risks.",
    "Secondary liquidity is often overstated—permissioned books and realistic turnover metrics matter more than hype.",
    "Standards fragmentation can create operational complexity; choose partners with clear SLAs and upgrade paths.",
    "Privacy requires design: access-controlled data layers and minimal disclosure beat public leakage by default."

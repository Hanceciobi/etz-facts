    "How should you store WLFI securely after purchase?",
    "What are the main risks for new investors (volatility, liquidity, and operational mistakes)?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with research: token purpose, supply rules, and what actually drives demand.",
    "Check liquidity and market conditions (spread, depth, and volume) before you size a trade.",
    "Use a small test transaction if the route, chain, or wallet is new to you.",
    "Move WLFI off exchanges to a wallet you control when the position matters.",
    "Keep backups offline and avoid exposing seed phrases, screenshots, or cloud sync."

    "start": "Decide what you’re doing: short-term speculation, long-term holding, or ecosystem use. Then size risk first, confirm liquidity, and lock down custody before increasing exposure.",

          "Limit position size and avoid leverage into meme-driven momentum.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Meme-driven assets can move fast in both directions; liquidity can vanish during stress.",
    "Operational mistakes (wrong token/network, unsafe links, weak custody hygiene) cause many avoidable losses.",
    "Diversification and sizing matter more than perfect timing for high-variance assets."

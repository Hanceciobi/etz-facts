  "keyQuestions": [
    "What is SocialFi, and how is it different from a typical social platform?",
    "What are creator tokens, and what real benefits can they unlock for fans?",
    "Which monetization models work without relying on ads?",
    "How can communities use governance without turning into “checkbox democracy”?",
    "What are the biggest UX and onboarding bottlenecks, and how do good products remove them?",
    "Which risks matter most (bots, fakes, whales, legal gray areas), and what mitigations actually help?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Define utility first: access, perks, and clear rules before you mint or launch points.",
    "Keep entry simple: reduce wallet friction, make fees predictable, and explain ownership in plain language.",
    "Design a fair economy: broad distribution, affordable entry, and perks that reward active supporters.",
    "Use governance for specific decisions with clear boundaries, not sweeping “vote on everything” politics.",
    "Maintain trust: publish official links, fight fakes/bots, and track real signals like onboarding drop‑off and engagement."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I want SocialFi/creator tokens to feel useful and sustainable, not hype-driven",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Your token has no clear utility beyond speculation",
        "then": [
          "Attach concrete perks: access, content, discounts, voting on narrow topics, or co-creation rights",
          "Write rules and benefit tiers in plain language and keep them stable",
          "Measure utility usage (redeems, participation) rather than price alone"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "New users drop off during onboarding or get stuck on wallets/fees",
        "then": [
          "Simplify the first step and explain keys/ownership once (short, friendly, non-technical)",
          "Make costs predictable (bundle/abstract fees where possible)",
          "Provide support that answers within 24 hours and has clear refund/issue policies"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Bots, fakes, or whales distort the community",
        "then": [
          "Publish a registry of official links and teach users how to verify them",
          "Use simple anti-bot gates and rotate reward rules to reduce farming",
          "Limit governance power per wallet and cap vote weight where needed"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Utility must lead: if perks don’t improve participation, attention fades and speculation empties communities.",
    "UX is the real filter—wallet setup and surprise fees are where most newcomers give up.",
    "Bots and impostors scale with attention; an official link registry and verification habits are essential.",
    "Governance works best for bounded decisions; vague “vote on everything” systems tend to break trust."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does “no KYC crypto exchange” really mean in 2025?",
    "How anonymous are no KYC swaps in practice, and what do services still see?",
    "What are the main risks: scams, mistakes, and changing regulations?",
    "How do wallets, networks, and coin choice affect privacy outcomes?",
    "How can you build a repeatable safety routine for no KYC swaps?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Define your goal (privacy, speed, access) and your constraints (fees, networks, legal/tax rules).",
    "Map your full route (on-ramp, wallets, swap step, off-ramp) and identify where KYC exists.",
    "Choose coins and networks that fit both privacy needs and liquidity/fee realities.",
    "Test with small amounts; verify networks, addresses, fees, and support responsiveness.",
    "Review habits regularly: address reuse, device/browser hygiene, and what you share in AI chats."
  ],
  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "If you want to use a no KYC exchange safely, start by deciding whether your priority is reducing data exposure, improving execution speed, or gaining access where KYC is difficult — then build a route that matches that goal.",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "Your priority is reducing identity/data exposure",
        "then": [
          "Prefer non-custodial swaps with no long-term account balances.",
          "Limit IP/device tracking (basic privacy settings) and avoid address reuse.",
          "Keep sensitive logs, screenshots, and full addresses out of AI chats and random support DMs."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Your priority is speed and simplicity for routine swaps",
        "then": [
          "Use highly liquid pairs and networks with predictable fees.",
          "Start with a small test swap when using a new route or asset.",
          "Keep a simple record of TXIDs and timestamps for troubleshooting."

  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "No KYC is not the same as invisible: on-chain activity and metadata can still be analyzed.",
    "Scam risk is higher around “anonymous exchange” keywords; verify track record and terms before sending funds.",
    "Operational mistakes (wrong network, wrong address) are often irreversible in non-custodial flows.",
    "Rules and exchange policies can change quickly; tax and reporting obligations may still apply."

  "keyQuestions": [
    "What does Changerella do versus what ETZ Swap does?",
    "How does this partnership reduce mistakes before you even send funds?",
    "Why is comparing swap offers safer than clicking the first search result?",
    "What changes when ETZ Swap appears inside a comparison dashboard?",
    "If something goes wrong, should I contact Changerella or ETZ Swap support?",
    "What basic checks should I do before I start any swap?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start in Changerella to compare offers side by side instead of hunting links in search results.",
    "Pick the route you actually want (rate, speed, network), not just the biggest number.",
    "When you open ETZ Swap from Changerella, switch into “verify mode” (domain, pair, network).",
    "Paste your receive address carefully and double-check chain + memo/tag rules before sending.",
    "After you deposit, wait for confirmations and share only safe details with support (TXID/order number), never seed phrases."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "Something feels off during the swap journey",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "The listing, comparison view, countdown, or display data looks wrong inside Changerella",
        "then": [
          "Refresh and re-check the same offer from a second device/network if possible",
          "Capture the offer details (pair, amount, timestamp) and report it to Changerella",
          "Do not send funds until the offer looks consistent"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You created an ETZ Swap order and funds were sent but status looks stuck or unclear",
        "then": [
          "Collect the TXID, deposit amount, and your order details",
          "Contact ETZ Swap support through official channels only",
          "Ignore DMs, “recovery agents,” and anyone asking for seed phrases or remote access"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "The biggest failures often happen at discovery: fake domains, spoofed links, and “too good” rates with hidden terms.",
    "Rates and network fees can move during market spikes; stability can matter more than a tiny headline advantage.",
    "Address and network mismatches are irreversible; treat every send like a bank transfer.",
    "Scammers target panic moments with fake support and recovery promises—verify channels and never share secrets."

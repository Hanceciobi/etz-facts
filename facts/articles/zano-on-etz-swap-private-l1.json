    "Open ETZ Swap and choose a ZANO pair that matches your funding asset, such as BTC→ZANO, USDT→ZANO or XMR→ZANO.",
    "Make sure your Zano wallet is updated, synced and ready, and skim the /en/coins/zano page if you need a quick refresher on how the network works.",
    "Generate a fresh ZANO receiving address, paste it into ETZ Swap, and double-check the network, quoted rate, minimum amount and time window before sending anything.",
    "Send a small test amount first, wait for the ZANO payout to appear in your wallet, and confirm that the balance is final and spendable.",
    "Once the test looks good, send the main amount within the time window shown on ETZ Swap and wait for confirmations until the full ZANO balance is credited."

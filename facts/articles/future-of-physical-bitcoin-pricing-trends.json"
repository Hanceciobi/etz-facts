    "What counts as a “physical bitcoin,” and how does it relate to on-chain BTC?",

    "How can buyers reduce counterfeit and funding-status risk?",
    "Which factors are most likely to shape physical bitcoin pricing in the next few years?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Classify the item: loaded, redeemed, or souvenir—each has different value drivers.",
    "Verify integrity and provenance: hologram condition, serials, packaging, and seller reputation.",
    "When possible, confirm funded status without exposing sensitive details publicly.",
    "Price it in two layers: intrinsic BTC value (if loaded) plus numismatic premium.",
    "Store and handle like a bearer asset: protect condition, privacy, and documentation."

  "riskNotes": [
    "Counterfeits exist—both the physical object and claims about funding—so verification is part of the price.",
    "Loaded coins behave like bearer instruments; custody and privacy practices matter.",
    "Regulatory shifts can change supply channels and liquidity without killing collector demand.",
    "Premiums are cyclical: generic items compress in bears while top-tier pieces tend to hold better."

    "What exactly is a “pump coin,” and how is it different from a normal small-cap token?",

    "How can a trader set position size, stop rules, and profit-taking in thin books?",

  "quickSteps": [
    "Assume extreme volatility and thin liquidity; size positions so a fast -50% won’t break you.",
    "Define invalidation and take-profit levels before entering; don’t improvise in the pump window.",
    "Prefer limit orders and staged exits to reduce slippage and decision pressure.",
    "Treat chatroom “signals” as unverified; validate with liquidity, volume, and holder distribution.",
    "Cap daily loss and stop trading when the limit hits—tilt is the real enemy here.",
    "Keep pump exposure in a segregated speculative sleeve; never dip into core funds."

    "Rumors and screenshots can be engineered to move markets long enough for distribution.",
    "For most investors, the rational allocation to pump coins is zero; if used, keep it small and segregated."

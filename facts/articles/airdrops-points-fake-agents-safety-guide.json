  "keyQuestions": [
    "How do fake airdrop and points campaigns actually drain wallets?",
    "What is the 60-second Source–Technical–Economics check before connecting a wallet?",
    "Which wallet popups are immediate red flags (approvals, permits, SetApprovalForAll)?",
    "How should I use a separate “claim” wallet so mistakes stay small?",
    "How do I verify bots, mini-apps, and “admins” in Telegram safely?",
    "What should I do right now if I already clicked or signed something suspicious?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Start only from an official announcement you can verify; match the domain letter-for-letter and avoid forwarded links.",
    "Before you connect, run the three-screen check: Source, Technical ask, and Economics (rules and dates must be clear).",
    "Reject broad permissions: SetApprovalForAll, IncreaseAllowance, “unlimited”, unclear permits, surprise chain/RPC switches.",
    "Claim from a separate low-balance wallet; keep savings elsewhere and revoke new permissions on a weekly habit.",
    "If something went wrong: revoke approvals/permits, move assets to a fresh address, save tx hashes, and warn others."

  "issueRouting": {
    "start": "I want to claim points/airdrops but something feels off",

      {
        "if": "The link came from a forward, DM, or screenshot and you can’t trace it to the project’s official site",
        "then": [
          "Do not connect your wallet or sign anything",
          "Find the announcement on the project’s official site/verified socials and compare the domain letter-for-letter",
          "If the domain or handle doesn’t match exactly, treat it as a scam and leave"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "Your wallet asks for broad approvals or vague permits (SetApprovalForAll, IncreaseAllowance, unlimited)",
        "then": [
          "Cancel the request immediately and close the page",
          "Repeat the check using a separate low-balance claim wallet only",
          "If you need to proceed, only sign narrow, time-bound actions tied to a verified contract"
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You already clicked, connected, or signed something suspicious",
        "then": [
          "Revoke recent approvals/permits as soon as possible",
          "Move remaining assets to a fresh wallet address",
          "Record tx hashes and timestamps for your notes and report the scam channel to your community"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Most drainers don’t need your seed phrase — they rely on rushed consent: approvals, permits, and signatures you didn’t fully read.",
    "Lookalike domains and compromised chat channels exploit urgency; always verify the source before connecting.",
    "Broad approvals (unlimited allowances, SetApprovalForAll) create lasting exposure even after you close the claim page.",
    "A separate low-balance claim wallet turns disasters into small losses; revoking permissions weekly keeps exposure short-lived."

  "quickSteps": [
    "Start with intent: decide whether you want to acquire XMR, spend it, or learn basics before you click anything.",
    "Use a curated directory for discovery, then switch to execution mode and stop browsing.",
    "Verify the execution entry point carefully, then double-check the receiving address before sending funds.",
    "Ignore unsolicited helpers and any request for secrets or remote access, no matter how urgent it sounds.",
    "After receiving XMR, choose your next step deliberately: secure storage first, then explore real use cases."

          "Do not start a second swap out of impatience.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Verified style labels are a trust signal, not a guarantee. Always verify the domain and the receiving address before sending.",
    "The highest-risk moment is before the first send. Reduce tab chaos and avoid search ads when possible.",
    "Never accept help that asks for secrets or remote access. Public transaction details are enough for legitimate support.",
    "Do not start a second swap in panic if a deposit is pending. Gather facts first and use official channels.",
    "Follow local laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Privacy tools are not the same as breaking rules."

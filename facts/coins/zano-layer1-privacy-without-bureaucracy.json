  "quickSteps": [
    "Pick your path: choose BTC, ETH, USDT or XMR as the source asset, set ZANO as the destination, and review the quote and time window.",
    "Prepare your wallets: ensure your source wallet is funded and have a fresh ZANO receiving address under your control ready to accept the swap.",
    "Double-check the details: verify the asset, amount, networks, destination ZANO address, and visible fees before broadcasting any transaction.",
    "Send your coins within the quote window; the non-custodial swap service waits for confirmations on the source chain and then issues the outgoing payment in ZANO.",
    "Confirm ZANO arrival in your wallet, compare it to the expected amount from the quote, and then hold, move, or spend it according to your own plan."

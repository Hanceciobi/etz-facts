    "Why convert part of USDT into XMR in the first place?",
    "What drives the USDT/XMR rate, and what part is spread vs slippage?",

    "How do you minimize all-in fees without weakening privacy?",
    "What does Monero protect on-chain, and what stays as off-chain metadata?",
    "What mistakes most often delay settlement (wrong network, bad address hygiene)?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Pick the USDT network that matches your fee and confirmation tolerance.",
    "Check the all-in cost (spread + network fees), not only the headline rate.",
    "Use a fresh XMR subaddress for organization and reduced linkage.",
    "Verify destination addresses every time to defeat clipboard swapping.",
    "Keep records privately (timestamps, receipts) without oversharing context.",
    "Treat privacy as routine: reduce metadata at the edges (device, IP, chats)."

        "then": [
          "Use a reputable XMR wallet and keep seeds offline (no screenshots/cloud).",
          "Prefer subaddresses per purpose and avoid public sharing of TX details.",

  "riskNotes": [
    "Wrong network selection is the most common cause of delays and manual recovery flows.",
    "Micro-tests can be disproportionately expensive on some rails; balance prudence with fee reality.",
    "On-chain privacy doesn’t protect you from off-chain metadata leaks (IP, screenshots, notes, KYC deposits).",
    "Optional privacy workflows can leak via mixed-mode behavior and smaller anonymity sets.",
    "Keep your own bookkeeping minimal and private; don’t publish transaction details."

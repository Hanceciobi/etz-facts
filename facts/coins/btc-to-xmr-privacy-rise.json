  "keyQuestions": [
    "Why are BTC to XMR conversions increasing for privacy-first users?",
    "What’s the practical difference between transparent settlement and private payments?",
    "How do stealth addresses, ring signatures, and RingCT protect everyday transfers?",
    "Where do conversions leak privacy in the real world (metadata, habits, records)?",
    "What routes reduce durable profiles when moving from BTC into XMR?",
    "Which records should you keep without over-sharing context?"
  ],
  "quickSteps": [
    "Decide whether you need transparent proof or private settlement for this move.",
    "Avoid address reuse and keep spending vs savings separated.",
    "Use Monero privacy defaults; don’t weaken settings for convenience.",
    "Prefer non-custodial, no-account routes when bridging into XMR.",
    "Save minimal artifacts (hash/receipt) privately for later reconciliation.",
    "Treat privacy as routine: reduce metadata at the edges (devices, chats, IP)."

    "start": "I want to convert BTC to XMR with minimal exposure — what should I do first?",
    "branches": [
      {
        "if": "You’re starting from a transparent chain and worry about linkage.",
        "then": [
          "Stop address reuse and separate contexts (personal vs business).",
          "Avoid public sharing of addresses, invoices, and screenshots.",

        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You need default-private payments after the conversion.",
        "then": [
          "Use a maintained XMR wallet and keep defaults enabled.",
          "Use subaddresses per context to avoid accidental linkage.",
          "Keep your network layer quiet when it matters (Tor/I2P, trusted nodes)."
        ]
      },
      {
        "if": "You’re choosing a conversion route.",
        "then": [
          "Prefer non-custodial swaps to avoid durable accounts and logs.",
          "Minimize round trips that create repeating patterns.",
          "Keep your own minimal receipts without attaching extra identity context."

      }
    ]
  },
  "riskNotes": [
    "Transparent chains create permanent linkable histories; privacy later can’t delete them.",
    "Metadata leaks (IP, timing, KYC deposits, chats) can undo strong on-chain privacy.",
    "Optional privacy modes in other systems can leak via mixed-mode usage and smaller anonymity sets.",
    "Over-sharing “proof” in public channels often reveals more than the payment itself.",
    "Custodial routes trade analysis risk for counterparty and seizure risk."
